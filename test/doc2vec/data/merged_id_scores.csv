p30," so how are you doing today? pretty well. good. good. tell me about yourself. i'm mickey. i am a course 6 majoring in mit and junior this year. i live in east campus. i think i was a bit too... oh, great. i'm from minnesota. tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. i was in apm. i was the fellowship as personal project. okay. which one of those was responsible for organizing a previous program? basically, it split into three sections. okay. so it was organizing events that helped foster friendship among those. three. okay. so tell me about a time you were working in a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? so we had this project a few weeks ago. okay. we did a split file and one of our group mates did the whole thing. oh, wow. yeah. okay. so the other two of us, we talked about what happened exactly. because both of us had just kind of fun streaming over there quickly. sure. and then we arranged a meeting with the ta to go and see if we could work out a solution. and we really ended up working out of it. okay. we were able to do the best, obviously, because we hadn't gotten to do the work. but we solved it. good. i haven't had this kind of interview for ever. i was trying to remember to ask you to code. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're trying to do to overcome it? i'm really quiet. oh, okay. i just speak really quietly. and it's because of my head it sounds louder than i guess it is. so i work on it. i try to project. i ask people to tell me if i'm being too quiet because i can't do it so. it's a real problem. great. and last question. why do you think we should hire you? for what? for our interview. for our interview. because i learn really quickly. okay. i bring a very positive attitude to the job. so i plan what i do. and i work hard at it. and i don't want to worry about it.",AGGR,3.64357955615,3.18966091988,3.76838867428,3.84773792992,3.01718663299,3.77718226795,5.25941439481,3.79194498091,4.72821575336,4.50753131862,5.32236121779,2.3043040744,3.59713349546,4.53579887894,4.13186019554,4.4322250852,5.3409377699,2.58584540875,71.7813085548
p24," how are you doing today? i'm doing very well. how are you? good. so, tell me about yourself. i'm currently a junior at mit. i'm studying biology. i am interested in pursuing some sort of future in medicine, but i don't know if necessarily like the med school route or more the research side, but you know having to do with patient care and drugs and things like that. within the broader field, but i'm not sure. specifically what path yet. great. so, tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership. okay. so, the summer after my sophomore year of high school, i actually went on a leadership trip. so, it was through my summer camp and some other camps that are part of the same foundation. we actually went on a trip to israel for the summer. and it was the first time i had ever been, which was very exciting. and it was a very cool experience because not only were they teaching a lot of leadership skills, but also a lot of you know the daily activities we did like going for really long hikes and things just kind of brought out that innate like someone has to make sure everyone brought enough water and you know make sure the group is staying together and things like that. so, that was definitely something that i think impacted me a lot and i think you know in other leadership roles, you know even in a small group project or something, a lot of the time i find myself reflecting back to that trip and kind of saying like okay we were in a tough spot like that before. how did we kind of rally the group back together? something like that. okay. okay. and can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and faced a challenge? what did you do to solve that problem? sure. so, i think the situation arised a lot of times in lab. so, i was, this past summer i was back in israel and working in a lab at the hebrew university. and it was a pretty small lab. i was working for one of the post-docs and then there were about four other people in the lab. and so, things like that kind of came up all the time where it would be a matter of okay we don't have the exact materials that we needed to do the experiment. can i borrow this from this lab? could someone check down the hall if maybe they have this? and just kind of that group mentality of making sure everyone was getting their experiments done. and then it was also interesting because there were a lot of language barriers that were going on in lab. because there were some israelis that were working there. and then one of the phd students was from russia and then two of the post-docs were from india. and so, the common language among them was english but in sort of a broken down manner in different ways. so, it was kind of interesting also coming in and sort of having to step into that role of almost like translating english to english for people and checking emails and making sure they made sense and things like that. okay. great. so, can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? sure. i think sometimes i tend to be a little bit on the shy side especially like if i'm the person coming into a new group or a new experience. and i think i just kind of have to remind myself like there's a reason why i'm here and i can add something to the experience even if it's not in a major sort of leadership necessarily role. like for example, the lab last summer i was the only undergraduate working there and so that kind of brought out that shy side because i walked in and you know everyone had already been working there and they were all much older and much more established in their fields. so just kind of keeping up the reminders that like i'm here to get something out of this experience and hopefully i can help out the lab while at the same time realizing that i'm not necessarily going to come up with a big breakthrough today and that's okay. and i still need to feel comfortable here and need to add what i can and then the rest will fall into place when it does. and i think just keeping those reminders coming that i don't have to be like the person solving the problem right away has kind of helped me to take a step back, relax, see what i can add to the table without freaking out that it's not enough. okay, great. and last question, why do you think we should hire you? i think for me where i am at this point where i'm deciding between sort of going the medical school route or the research route, the more time i spend in a hospital setting i think definitely will enable me to kind of make those distinctions between if it's the one-on-one patient care that i care more about or sort of the overarching like how are these people being cured more from the scientific standpoint. and i think just sort of that open-mindedness towards both sides will help out the hospital a lot because you know it's always good to have people that are interacting between the pure doctors and the pure scientists level and someone that has interest in both areas and can kind of mediate and interact between those two. great. okay.",AGGR,5.77173303692,6.01571666404,5.73303596655,6.07286554433,6.01493975978,6.05367615561,6.43726667033,4.46527835631,4.68477352611,6.56263386472,6.15912983982,5.91414269143,4.85459639205,5.78303818694,5.57769053034,6.08548008293,6.20313838421,5.88297420383,104.272109856
p25," how are you doing today? i'm good. how are you? i'm doing well. so tell me about yourself. i'm a course 16 here at mit, which is aeronautical and astronautical engineering. i'm a junior. and my experience has been, last summer i worked with nasa glenn research center doing interplanetary rover work. i was doing design work with jeff landis as my mentor. so yeah, i had a really good time working on that project, doing a lot of malab coding, making a lot of design decisions, as well as separately working on a project with just my fellow interns where we built an autonomous navigation system for a drop-sand, which is a meteorological measuring device. but we didn't worry about the drop-sand itself. we were just concerned with building the navigation system so that it could be recovered by the people who are using it. and i personally worked on the steerable parafoil parachute for that. great. all right. so can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership? yes, i can. and we were working on the drop-sand project, which i mentioned before. there was some question about whether we were going to be able to get a good drop site for it because in order to test how the navigation system works, we had to have the thing flying for us and having it in a period of time. so it was fairly, it takes not very long for most things to fall from reasonable height. so we had to find a really good drop location. and we were having a lot of trouble with that. and we were pursuing some options with working with nasa, but it didn't look like they were going to work out. and i took the initiative and i went and i contacted the owner of this airport where we had been skydiving there previously in the summer. so we like spoke to the owner there before, but not about anything official. we just said, hi, we're skydiving at your airport. but i called him, talked to him about it, and got actually a plane and a free flight for our team to go and be able to drop our project, which was pretty significant for the success of the project. great. and tell me about the time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? well, i guess i should probably pick a different time that i was working on a team. so for the venus rover, which was the other project that i worked on last summer, we basically started just with nothing because this idea is really in early design phases. it's not like there's no venus rover being built by any team. it's just people sitting down, working equations, figuring out what could be feasible for a venus rover. so there's a lot of flexibility there, a lot of room to sort of figure out what we thought would work out best. and initially, there are two basically competing ideas. there was the idea of using a wind turbine to power the rover versus having it actually be a land sailor. and there was no clear answer regarding which one of those was better. the wind turbine had some advantages in that it would be able to sit in charge of the it would be able to sit still and accumulate power as the wind blew on it. so it wouldn't have to be moving constantly. whereas the land sailor would have to have some threshold level of wind to move to overcome static friction. if it didn't have that, then it wouldn't be able to do anything useful. so in that way, the turbine seemed a little bit less risky, but the turbine also has more moving parts and it would require a little bit more on the electronic side. and that's riskier as well. so it was not a clear decision. and basically the team was split between wanting to do the turbine and wanting to do the land sailor. so what we ended up doing was, i was pro-turbine, so i ended up doing an analysis of the wind turbine and my fellow intern was pro-land sailor, did an analysis of the land sailor. me and the rest did anything super in-depth, but we just did a basic analysis. and then we compared our numbers. we looked through each other's processes, made sure that we were sort of working from the same assumptions, which we were, because we both did an honest job with it. and then we just went based on the math, which one seemed like it was going to work out better. so it ended up being very non-confrontational. good. and which ended up being working better? the turbine did, which i was happy about. great. okay. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? yeah, i am not extremely well organized. so, yeah, my work tends to be a little bit of a mess and i have trouble meeting deadlines. but i overcome it just by recognizing something that will happen to me where my work will become sloppy and i won't miss deadlines if i don't really pay attention to it. so i do, by writing down deadlines and giving a google calendar, try to keep us on top of things. and why do you think we should hire you? i think you should hire me because i am intelligent and hardworking. and i think that, i think my grades at mit really prove that i am intelligent and hardworking. and i think that, as well as that, i also have the experience that you would want at jpl working on interplanetary rovers. i've done that before. i've also worked on teams to try to accomplish goals. so i think that really i am a pretty well qualified applicant for this position. great.",AGGR,5.01663651881,4.86769721353,5.22631337469,5.23750674843,5.04111863294,4.36481063995,5.29878378716,4.41765021419,2.65871530818,5.26243597731,5.64989437318,4.70942794447,4.65014861926,5.00726356573,5.20802386978,5.51561952404,5.92273458331,4.10372023153,88.1585011265
p31," how are you doing today? good. good. right? yep. so tell me about yourself. well i'm a junior, i'm an mit student. i'm majoring in both math and computer science. what sort of skills and interests are you looking to find out about? just like a general idea of what your interests are and what kind of goals you're looking for in terms of the future. cool. well i'm really interested in distributed systems actually. okay. and that's more as a research interest and the sort of application that it generally tends to have when i look at companies is parallel computing. i actually did an internship last summer with amazon and for them i ended up doing a lot of parallel computing with the hidi platform. i'm also taking 6172 which is a performance engineering class and we do a lot of parallelism in c++. great. so tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. well this was in high school but in high school i was the president of my robotics team as well as the, in the earlier years, the head of respectively the mechanical engineering team and our mechanical arm team. and you know that was a good leadership experience. i've also been, you know, in 6172 we have group projects. there are only two people but in some of the projects i've been through, the person doing a lot of the organizing. yeah. okay. so tell me about a time you're working on a team and face a challenge. how did you solve that problem? are you more interested in a technical challenge or like in working with people challenge? i mean in any situation where you're working with people there is an issue. okay. well in my, in 6172, the class i'm taking right now, i was working with jason. he is a friend of mine and we were both working on the first project. and we were trying to improve our speed in order to get up to the benchmark for like good fastness of improvement. and we had to prioritize different choices in terms of what might actually speed up our code by approximately 500 fold. yeah, it was pretty intense. and we as such like sort of had to try and parallelize the work and it was pretty hard because the code like merging to code documents is never fun. and there was really only one document we were working on. what ended up happening is that i spent most of the time driving, which is to say coding and him watching and sort of verifying my algorithm. but it was, it was stressful because we were getting close to the deadline. and if we didn't finish this optimization, we'd have to turn it in an old version, which was only 10 times faster. it's supposed to 500 times faster. we ended up getting it not 500 times faster, but 100 times faster. okay. so i was quite pleased. but like working with him is sort of both working on the strategies of how to fix this all a technical problem as fast as possible. given that we had two people's worth of man hours, but only like an actual hours. and thinking about solutions to that technical problem was very interesting. okay, great. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? i, when i get stressed, tend to get a little snippy with people i'm working with. i think it is not uncommon. but definitely when i'm, especially when i'm tired, it's like 4am in the morning and i'm working with people. when they're trying to explain something to me or i'm trying to explain something to them, there's like inherent overhead. and that can be very frustrating. and it causes me to like be short with people when like they're trying to explain things with me or i'm explaining it with them. and it's something i'm working on because it doesn't actually make communication any more effective. it just makes everyone unhappy. so there's a couple of things. one is that like i have to stay up working late on things. and so like i never really get practiced working it not being snippy. but also like having recognized that this is something that i do, something that is not effective for communication. i have been trying to pay attention to, you know, my tone of voice, my friendliness. and i've been trying to like take the approach that when i do have to communicate in these situations to like optimize by minimizing the communication needed. and by being expressively relaxed during the periods of communication. because even if i need to like be working hard and sort of stressing out about the work, like the communication portion doesn't need to take up much time. and so if it takes twice as long, like it doesn't actually like matter because that's not the time you need to optimize. great. last question. why do you think we should hire you? i think you should hire me because i'm technically qualified. i get along well with people. i am interested in these fields. like i'm excited about computer science. it's like what i want to do. it's a large part of who i am is like the math and computer science part of me. and as a result, i'm going to enjoy work and enjoy working with people. also the people i spend my time with outside of work will tend to be very similar kinds of people to the kinds of people i'll be interacting with at work. and so it tends to work out pretty well. in my previous internship with amazon, my team liked me a lot because i'm pretty laid back and enjoy joking around with people. bake the food, you know. so i, yeah, you know, i will solve your technical problems and i'll get along with the team. great.",AGGR,4.57767820678,4.53062038369,4.49215445248,5.06145447806,5.32994428642,4.54540203239,5.35520340256,4.98325096409,3.73571462122,4.9466683884,5.41646730296,4.93984116647,4.72572824874,5.28404524329,5.21779803149,5.68451601088,5.3419899654,4.48163748302,88.6501146683

p32," ready. so how are you doing today? good, how are you? good. tell me about yourself. so i'm a junior in chemical engineering. i'm very interested in energy applications. so from alternative energy to more traditional sources, so basically oil, fossil fuels, and kind of optimizing that industry, i think there's a lot of potential there. so that's that's where my main interest is. and can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership? yeah. so i'm vice president of corporate relations for the society of women engineers. and we just held in september a career fair banquet. so we have a dinner for about 200 people following the career fair. and it's a huge event to organize in the sense that students need to be matched up with companies that suit their interests for dinner. so the goal is just to have kind of a relaxed networking event after you know the hecticness of the career fair. and to just give people a chance to talk. and so i was working with a committee of six people which i was the leader of. and i think one thing that i really did to make sure that the event went smoothly was delegate tasks very early on. so one of the things that happened in the previous year when i was one of the team and not leading the team was it became very disorganized because we didn't know what the other tasks were the other people were doing. and in the end we ended up having to work throughout the event to keep things running smoothly. and i wanted the team members to be able to sit down and have dinner as well. so in the end it ended up running very well. and kind of we all got to have dinner too. so that was awesome. great. so how about a time you're working on a team and face the challenge? how did you solve that problem? so one of our senior design or not our senior but one of our design classes within chemical engineering asks us to design a chemical plant in one of the software programs we use. and so it's a very big project but it's very modular. so you can have somebody working on distillation column somebody working on the separator. and so one of the challenges within that is making sure everybody's keeping up with their part of the project. and so one challenge that i faced within that project was making sure that one particular person was thoroughly involved because it's a lot of work to do and we can't really afford to have anyone kind of slacking off. so kind of to address that problem i sat down with him and kind of had a conversation about you know we're all feeling kind of the strain of this project the deadline's coming but you know we can't have anyone sitting on the sidelines. what is it that you want to get more involved in? or where do you think your skills are? and it turned out that he wasn't very comfortable writing the code in the program and so he didn't want to write buggy code and just have somebody else trying to like fix his work all the time. but he was very tight with the teaching assistants and so he could funnel our questions through them and get us some good answers back from them so that we could keep going with the project. so through that conversation we found a way for him to contribute. great. tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it. i think kind of within my personality i have a lot of like go go go and a lot of times i don't realize that waiting might be the best option that you know just letting certain events take their course may in fact be the best option. so kind of giving an example of this is when i was trying to decide which internships or which internship offers to accept i kind of was very anxious to kind of pick one go with it and kind of get started meeting people within that company and figuring out what i wanted to do and i think in that circumstance it would have been better. after i had accepted an offer i would have got other offers that i of course couldn't consider because i was already tied to one particular offer and in that circumstance it definitely would have been better to wait to see how things panned out and just you know communicate with other people saying that you know i really do think that pushing the deadline is the best option in this you know in this circumstance. so kind of this year now i've definitely waited for everything to pan out before making a decision and it has worked out really well actually. i was very tempted to give a response to one of the offers i received but over this last weekend i actually went to a conference and it changed my mind. both companies that i was deciding between were at the conference and talking to their representatives really helped me so i'm glad that i waited to you know hit the buttons. great and last question. what do you think we should hire? i think that i have the ability to contribute really well to the group so not just bringing the knowledge or the skills that are in your job description but also kind of the enthusiasm the willingness to contribute my ideas to a discussion and really immerse myself in what's going on would make me a stellar candidate i would think. great.",AGGR,6.29487349634,6.14885632085,6.18298546935,6.01056045187,6.06934933724,5.77622119569,6.72840513159,4.82608322541,3.93612393329,6.72840513159,5.83214366867,5.98211754597,5.39823147181,5.46293333461,6.09992042466,6.29234838489,6.54125576806,5.82273135248,106.133545644
p22," ready? so how are you doing today? i'm good. how are you? good. so tell me about yourself. okay. i'm a junior in aerospace engineering. i'm originally from kansas city and i was born on the east coast. i'm currently deciding whether or not i want to go into aerospace industry or go into consulting or another management-related field. and i'm minoring in management at slo. great. so can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership? so right now i'm actually quite involved with the global poverty initiative here at mit. and i'm currently the director of action under gpi global poverty initiative. so i'm currently in charge of projects that we are involved with abroad. so that includes projects in mexico, service projects in central mexico, as well as a project with a domestic, or an ngo in india that works with domestic workers and setting up domestic workers with local employers and training women and working with employee-employee relationships. most of my work has been on the mexico project and i led a team. i actually have traveled down three times. and we have a greenhouse initiative that is our main goal right now. and i oversaw a team of four people on two separate trips where we built 14 greenhouses, as well as conducted classes at a secondary school, as well as classes for adults in both computers and english. and we worked with ngos on the ground and they've actually managed to continue our projects since we've been gone, as well as working with the peace corps. and they've actually recently decided to send a full-time peace corps volunteer to the rural community where we were working. that was really validating. good. okay. so tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? okay. well, most of the challenges that i faced with the team have been with my projects in mexico. so probably the largest challenge that we had when we got there was working across cultures and identifying with community members. because when we went there, we had originally thought, we had brainstormed project ideas like solar ovens and greenhouses and biodigesters, which are used to make fertilizer from natural waste. and when we got there, we talked to lots of community members and first of all, they can be rather skeptical of outsiders coming in. so we first had to earn their trust and we had to establish that we weren't going to just come in and give them something and leave them. and this wasn't going to be a handout. so it was interesting being a leader within my group and trying to help those who had not had the same experiences with other cultures and working with people across borders. so helping those people adjust as well as working that relationship between rural mexicans who have limited experience with outsiders and are used to either government handouts or people coming in and doing one thing and leaving and not following up. and so that was a challenge, but in the end we ended up using community feedback to determine which project we wanted to do. so they were most interested in greenhouses as well as some amount of small business and we ended up catering to both of those project ideas. and the way that we decided to work around the not wanting to seem like we were giving a handout, we actually had all the families build their own greenhouses with our help. so we distributed all the materials and then had them pay small deposits so that they would have some small investment into the project. obviously they couldn't afford to pay for the whole thing. and then we worked with each individual family and they built it and made it their own and then they had a bigger incentive to take care of it. great. okay, can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? yeah, sometimes i can be disorganized. i mean i think everyone struggles with that a little bit. but the way that i try to deal with that is recently i've taken to becoming a list person in order for me to ensure that i get things done. i always get things done, but when you leave things for the last minute sometimes the quality of your work is not always the best. so to deal with this i've tried to break down all the problems and break down my tasks into small steps, make lists, and then set separate deadlines for each individual thing, knowing that if i have things that come up and everything is all due at the same time, everything needs to be done at once, i can try to handle that. and also i've learned that it's important to delegate your tasks, especially with gpi being director of action, a lot of the responsibility falls on me and it can be very easy to be like, oh y'all i need to take care of this and talk to these people. but that's why i have a team. right. so there are 20 people on gpi action so in order to delegate those tasks it makes my life easier and it keeps other people involved. great. okay. last question. okay. how are you? i think i have a diverse skill set and i have a very diverse background working with other cultures, not only in mexico but i've had experiences in europe and in china and i'm biracial myself. and i think i have a very unique background and especially as an engineer who's interested in going into consulting and i have work experience at spacex and nasa and other companies, i think i offer a very unique perspective into what your company culture would be. and i think that's very important in not having everyone have the same background and everyone in your community. you need different perspectives in your environment and i think i would definitely help fill that. great. okay.",AGGR,5.29356410776,4.97891595559,4.93636495451,4.98940167615,3.93794896466,4.90461927466,4.84475468234,4.54481259933,4.06072996124,4.36244591073,5.59690180362,3.5620510515,4.75560066436,5.41205700825,5.20529234374,5.8032252977,5.75599580843,5.33095726662,88.2756393312

so currently i'm looking for an internship for the summer. i actually, i'm exploring like the industry side of like computer science and i think that if i find like a position or if i find like the industry side like really suits me then i would want to go for like being hired by a company after i graduate. great. so tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. okay, so this, i guess this happens quite a bit during my stint as campus life editor of the tech. so what happens is like for my section i have to make sure that the publication is like going out on time. so one time i demonstrated leadership was in getting a column for the campus life section. so there was a, the president of the panhellenic society wanted to have like a column in the tech for greek life. and so i negotiated with her to like sort of to arrange like how the column would work because like i guess we both had the same like intent of like publishing articles but her ideas were slightly different for the mind in that she, if your original idea was that she wanted to, like it was kind of like advertisement in the tech and people like the tech is a newspaper you don't necessarily want articles to be like advertising sororities. so he made a deal with her to like write articles that would be more about the personal side and not like too advertising. okay, great. so tell me about a time you were on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? i guess again, probably using, let me see. okay, so i guess again, probably using, let me see. okay, so i guess i was on a team and faced a challenge. okay, so i guess again on for the tech because it's like my major leadership, my pretty big extracurricular. i guess what happened was, i really don't know how to answer these kinds of questions. sorry. it's okay, take your time. okay, i guess i'll go back to high school then. so at high school i was on the cross country team and so what happened was we, like we're competing, right? so we had to like train and things, so on, so on, team sports. and what happened was kind of that, so there's a girls team and a boys team and like the boys team was, i guess the boys were like more motivated and things like that and like they would, and the girls team was like less motivated and so like since they were less motivated they would do stuff like cut, like if the coach asked you to like run around this block then they would like sort of cut, take like short cuts and stuff like that. i guess what happened was, there was another student on the team who was also like really motivated and i wanted to improve running. so i think initially i guess we sort of tried asking people like hey, could you not do that? but eventually what happened was i guess me and the other more motivated girl trained with the boys team because it was really like, i mean there's, i get you there's motivating people but in the sense like they have to want to do it themselves. so i guess that's what happened. okay. great. so can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? okay. i would, let me think, one of my, i guess one weakness i have is, well mit is full of smart people right? if everybody is like always doing like these amazing projects and they were like coding since they were like nine years old and like all that stuff. so because of this like abundance of geniuses, sometimes they feel like i'm not as at their level. so i guess what i tried to do is like, i was feeling like sort of badly but then i realized well first of all, i guess everybody has to start somewhere and i've been like training my own skills like reach up to the, to like just learn more in depth and like eventually i'll get that good just takes like practice and i've also been like just sort of telling myself it's to like just apply to things and like don't, and i guess sort of fake it until you make it right? like project the image of like confidence and then it will probably come. great. and last question, why do you think we should hire you? well, so i have, well i've been learning a lot about computer science since i was here. i am a pretty reliable person. so like for example, during the tech, i always like am reliably like editing everything, getting things in time on deadline. so if you gave me an assignment, then i would reliably like work on it and and and like not procrastinate anything like that. i'm pretty good at learning as demonstrated by my ability to succeed at mit. and i also, i would really enjoy working and contributing to the google community as a person. and i hope that i would be able to produce good products. great.",AGGR,3.33252171655,3.24399530193,4.20505182183,4.98940167615,4.57800636939,5.54012570529,5.39460559604,4.51327848284,2.64383071631,5.37712385753,5.49465257443,4.43856006215,2.80873146245,4.00232978888,3.86149649712,5.06388733079,6.13526594477,3.571453726,79.1943186305

p34," so how are you? i'm doing pretty well. good. like, night, but yeah. tell me about yourself. so i'm a junior in course two at omniti. i just started course two last semester, but i got very interested in product design when i took the class called toy product design. it was really cool because we got to work in small teams to make our own projects, so ours was a toy called comic control. and my main role is to do a lot of the solid work things, so a lot of the cad and 3d modeling, so that we could make the physical components that didn't already exist. and i really enjoyed that because it's kind of an intersection between design, like art and engineering, which i never really thought of until last year. outside of classes, i try to do a lot of design work as well, maybe in somewhat different fields. like i work for the tech as a production editor. okay. so it's a lot of making infographics and laying out the entire newspaper, making it look really pretty. so it's kind of a good break from equations and things like that. alright. tell me about the time you demonstrated leadership. i think a very recent example is i am blent the peacher of missouri. so we just held an event called catwalk and it took 10 months of planning. oh wow. it took a long time, but it took a lot of delegation, a lot of staying on top of things because there were so many components we needed to coordinate. we ended up having 14 designers, but we had to contact way more than that from around the boston area. and the sorority has 140 girls in it, so all of them have to participate in some way, whether it's working with a designer or helping me to create the decoration scheme or work in logistics. and i personally think it ran really smoothly as a result of extreme organization. i had a co-chair and another girl helping me organize it and we got very good at creating tabs on google docs. we started out with things. great. and can you tell me about the time you were working on a team in face of challenge? how did you solve that problem? so when i go back to toy projects, toy product design, because i think that was a really good example. i think all of us were, it was a team of three freshmen and two sophomores. none of us had that much experience with product design at all. so we were all bringing different skills to the table and different ideas, different preferences, all our visions for what we wanted to do. and they clashed a lot in the beginning. it was really difficult for us, like our personalities clashed as well, and i just had ideas, which was really difficult to work with because meetings were unproductive and we just felt like we weren't moving anywhere because other teams were moving forward with their ideas, prototyping and things. and we were still arguing over what design would be most feasible, which was interesting. so we worked with that by finally just, it took a lot, we worked with like our mentors. talking to them as kind of a mediator, so for this, it wasn't a completely self-motivated resolution, or self-initiated, i don't know how to describe it. but it ended up working out. we all kind of slowed down, took a step back and solved from each other's perspectives, talked out very explicitly what the pluses and minuses of each idea were, and what our goals were given the constraints of the class, being that we had a $200 budget and just a semester to complete it, and at this point like a month left to complete it. and in the end, we just recognized each other's strengths so that we could each take on, take responsibility for a certain component of the toy, and figure out a way to just melt them all together into the final product. and we did, by the end, we had something that we were really proud of, like a lot of teams. i ended up relying a lot on their mentors to kind of do the project for them. but because we each wanted to take so much ownership of the project, it was very much our own, and we were able to present it on the final day, and something that was very rewarding. great. okay. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? i think one of my weaknesses is my lack of assertiveness, or lack of confidence in a way. like i always want to make sure that everyone's ideas are heard, and i feel like lots of times i don't want to create conflict, so i'll kind of back down after a little bit. i'm very open to sharing my ideas, but if there's a lot of criticism, then i will back down, and that's something that i'm working on a lot. like just trying to stand behind my own ideas, trying to be much more objective about them so that i have reasons to present, so that i don't feel like there's any reason for me to need to back down. that makes sense. and why do you think we should hire you? i think you're trying to me because i'm very passionate about product design. i feel like it's something that people told me when i started with cad engineering last semester, they were like, you just lit up and i can see that you found your passion here. i feel like i'm very detail oriented, so i'm able to create cad models in a very methodical manner instead of just drawing random things together. i'm able to think about design for manufacturing overall, and not just what looks nice on paper, but what's actually practical. i think i am a great team player in that even though i can be passive sometimes, in a way it's good to have people with different levels of aggressiveness and different levels of confidence, because that way it's not all like letting heads all the time. and i think that as i improve in my own confidence, it will come to a level where i'm able to work smoothly and not confrontationally with people, but also get things done very effectively.",AGGR,5.49048991179,5.56476015269,5.27930793403,5.61927630221,5.84916849292,5.15186505174,5.45967708011,4.81149020615,4.28975556068,6.17421775434,5.45901953558,5.195595851,4.50915597265,5.17223604377,5.35455981163,5.81847256707,6.1112403399,5.22618170363,96.5364702719
p84," so how are you doing today? well, thank you. good. how about you? pretty good. tell me about yourself. all right. well, as you probably know, i'm a junior in mit, a material science and engineering, and i've spent a bit of time doing some research in material science, but i've also recently declared a minor in course two, which is, sorry, it's mechanical engineering. so i'm looking for a bit of practice in industry. i've had some research experience. i've taken a range of classes in engineering, and i'm hoping to try out what it's like to combine the two, basically, mechanical and materials engineering. great. how about a time you demonstrate a leadership? okay. i could give you an example of a club i'm in. sure. at mit and in amnesty international, which is a student human rights organization, and it's very decentralized, it's very student-owned, and we kind of just make it whatever we want to make it in a given time. so it takes a lot of initiative to really hold the club together, and we were trying to pull together a big event last semester, which involved professor noam chomsky, who had to talk about arab spring, and we were hosting it in a huge lecture hall. so a big venue, hoping, expecting a lot of people. but it took a lot of work, and none of us had really pulled such a huge event before. i'd say i took a lot of initiative that i hadn't taken before in pulling that event together. i came to meetings and made sure everybody was on task, made sure that everybody had an awareness of what could go wrong as well as what kind of repercussions we might be expecting, if things did fall out of hand with a high-profile speaker, as well as some contentious issues being discussed. so, yeah, i did my best to really pull the team together as best as i could. i didn't have an official leadership role, so my participation was ambiguously defined, but it was fun having a role. great. and how about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge? how did you solve that problem? that's a good question. i was on the orientation group. i was an orientation leader this beginning of this year, and so we're paired off into different groups. we were the brown team, and we had a few problems getting energy with the team, and all of these freshmen, we knew that they were excited to be there. of course. we knew that they wanted to get to know each other and mit, but there was something blocking them from talking and from getting out of orientation what they should have. so we pulled together as a bit of a brown group team. we had a group discussion after, i think it was the second day, and we took a few tries to pull together some new icebreakers that hadn't been in the booklet that they prepared us for, and just whipped that out the next day, started yelling, got the kids off their feet and jumping, and one of my other co-orientation leaders and i were yelling different questions at them and had to pair up or group up based on the question that we asked them, and it didn't really work, necessarily. everybody participated though, and it got them blood-moving, and it got them kind of talking to new people, so even though the game didn't have a point, it ended up being kind of fun. it was a good way of getting to know my teammates as well. that's great. so we worked together really well on that. all right. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? yes. so i have a weakness for over-committing sometimes, and what i have been doing in the last year or so, well, since i came to mit, but particularly this year, is cutting back on things that don't mean much to me, cutting back on things that have always just been interests that i've never seen myself progressing in. so, for example, i took a small leadership role in my sorority, like my freshman year, but i don't see myself going very far in the leadership in my sorority, so i cut that kind of thing out, and i've been focusing on classes, sailing. i'm on the sailing team and amnesty international, and those are my three main focus things. so although i do do other things like i was an orientation leader, when i have time, i give tours from my job, campus tour, getting, but i've been getting better. i've been studying more on track with classes this way, and having sailing has definitely helped. so a bit of self-discipline and cutting back on things is helping me out. helping me not overcommit. good. and what do you think we should hire you? because i've researched into your company, and i think it's, i see a lot of it in the experience that i've had, i've had international experience in companies of a scale similar to yours, although it was in the research department, and i think that i could bring that international perspective. i've lived in several countries as well, and i have, besides being an engineer, i have a lot of practice with teamwork and with leadership roles in my community and my student groups, even in my pset groups doing homework. we have to pull together a lot of presentations and a lot of group reports for the material science major here, and i've really, i've developed a lot of skills that i think will really help your company. great.",AGGR,5.95405680479,6.28206002452,6.05443316509,6.06892342498,5.74806391498,5.96578786707,6.48113938355,4.95266403677,4.53483256915,6.60379494668,5.9541839413,6.07671236792,5.51848839033,5.52459319386,6.07230918336,6.13712525857,6.37892017774,5.32753985797,105.635628509
p53," tell me about yourself. well, i was born in nigeria and i moved to united states at the age of eight. i've lived here in boston actually ever since. and for as long as i remember, i've always wanted to go into the medical field. i've always wanted to be a doctor and just recently actually discovered that i wanted to be a pediatrician. after working with kids, i've done a lot of babysitting in high school. i've actually shadowed a neonatologist and i thought that was when it clicked that i actually really wanted to be a pediatrician. i've tutored a lot middle school and high school. and that's really like affirmed the fact that i do my career. i want it to be something where i work with kids. so, tell me about how you've demonstrated leadership. time of demonstrating leadership. i guess one obvious one is the student groups that i work with. my primary student group is the black student union. i'm currently a coach here. i've been active with the group since i've been at mit. currently as a coach here, i plan all the events for the group as well as kind of represent the group in front of administration as far as like what our members want, what they need, if they have any concerns or anything like that. and we have several meetings with administration on a regular basis just to communicate what's going on, what we're doing, and what our membership needs and how they can help us with that. tell me about a time you're working on a team and face a challenge. how do you solve that problem? team face a challenge. okay, i guess back to the student group. so this is the second time i've actually been on the executive board. the first last year the executive board ran really smoothly. we worked well together, but this year we were kind of having problems because it's a new set of people, so it's kind of hard adjusting. to the people that i'm working with. so you know, we all have different viewpoints, different ways of approaching things. so we had a lot of loss of communication which kind of hindered our progress this year. but in the past few weeks you've been able to kind of figure out that you know there's been a loss of communication and we should definitely like you know, we need to figure out how to stop that barrier and learn more to communicate more in order to get things that we want to accomplish done. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome that? my weaknesses... i think my biggest weakness is not knowing when to say no. i'm the kind of person that someone asks me to do something even if i feel like it's impossible. i always say yes. and i've always, i think i realized that problem when i came to mit and i've been working on it ever since my sophomore year. i'm an immigrant right now and what i've been doing to overcome it was kind of schedule myself. i have my calendar. i live by my calendar and i know if it doesn't fit in my calendar, if it's overlapping with something, then absolutely no, i can't do it. so i live by my calendar now and it's definitely helping me say no to things and people ask me to do things for them. and why do you think we should hire you? what do you think is a good example? i think that i am a good asset. one, because my mit experience has definitely prepared me for i would say the worst because of the experience as an mit student. it's a unique experience. but i've also gained a broad range of academic skills, not just in the life sciences, but also in engineering field and political science field that i think i can bring into the medical field with the help of the knowledge that i gain in medical school to kind of help the world, which is what i want to do ultimately. so i think i would be a good asset for the medical field.",AGGR,5.18476589488,5.31944902643,5.11410136982,5.36838427387,4.83837206285,4.06131929879,5.45096467796,4.91890261865,2.47243815689,5.45415149089,5.36048544669,4.85432054813,4.71024567086,5.17994323382,4.8915576213,5.44210458956,5.83862548193,5.29546986466,89.755601328

p85," so please tell me about yourself. ok, so i'm a junior here at mit, majoring in 20 and 6. and i guess it's an interesting combo by engineering and eecs. and then i think i just came into mit thinking i do by engineering. and then i guess i took a programming class for the first time in my freshman year of ip. and just like really fell in love with the logic, the clarity. and so i worked on a couple of biology labs. and i guess the one frustrating thing is that experiments take weeks or months to set up. sometimes you think it's just go wrong. and you don't really know why. and then i think i like the instantaneous feedback of like coding, things like that. so last year i decided to double major. and then the share really gets really checking out the more computer science side of things. excellent. was that a little fun? so you took a bit of time. when you demonstrated leadership? ok. so i think i'm on my class council. so one of the things we have to do was to send people elected every year. we are our job is to plan events for the class for event unity, just like study breaks. but some music goes beyond that. and i guess through that role, oftentimes i've just seen an idea from inception all the way to it's not in planning, to like delegating tests to day of execution. and then just following that entirely through. so i guess that just involves first just coming out, brainstorming ideas. so like for example, this past this week on tuesday, since it's not healthy for many people at mit, we decided to have a big study break. we decided to go on campus. we rented out the cookie monster truck from boston. and then just drove around. we had six stops on campus. it was all the dorms that even across the river. so i had to bring the study break to them so people could. didn't have to spare that much time. cookies and hot cocoa. i guess my role is just, oh, i thought about that idea. and then just coordinated with people, sent made shifts to people, designed the stops. and then just made sure publicity was good. and everything came together. it's a very smart idea. i like it. so hold this for a minute. at the time, when you're working on a team and faced a challenge, how do you go about resolving? okay. so i guess i'm a fraternity. and then one of the things, we have like a lot of officers. and then i guess one of the things is that sometimes, people obviously at mit, people get very busy. and i guess one of the things is sometimes people, maybe they have like an ambitious goal they set out for you. and then it just happens that they get busy or like they lose track of things. and then they get sidetracked. and so i guess it's always challenging to try to keep them engaged into that officer position. and like, because like they are, for a couple of reasons, one, do you want to make it rewarding for them? and then two, i mean, you want to see them follow their goals. and three, they are like setting an example for say like younger students or other people that may be interested. so i guess the challenge then is to overcome this. so i'm usually following up them individually, seeing like, maybe like, hey, what's going on? like no one's interested in this. or you're just busy. and then i think it depends on case by case basis. like if they're just maybe a little bit absent minded, then maybe like setting like weekly, just like kind of like deliverables or like milestones or goals to get it done piece by piece is one way. and they're not interested anymore. maybe you try to think of like some other idea that they may be interested in or willing to plan to. or maybe like they can work in a group with someone else. so someone else can keep them track. so i guess just telling the solution to the individual problem. yes. that's a problem. so tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome. okay. i think sometimes i can be a little like, like and unsure myself or like, doubting like when making a very large decision. so i guess when i like usually in leadership roles, i prefer something like second to command. since like i do like making sure things get done and like following up to make sure. but i always like the fallback of having someone else to consult with to talk about my thought process and things like that. and i guess generally i try just to overcome that by basically reaching out to other people, like other people on team or someone else. even maybe not associate that has experience in that field. just to maybe like illustrate my thought process, see if they see any flaws, see if they see something like maybe a perspective i didn't think about. and then just generally trying to get more viewpoints so that i feel more confident in my own decision or like i reevaluated account for things that i didn't think of before. i guess. that was a bit strange. so now i'd like you to think of a job that you'd like to have. do you want to know why? so actually that's one of the things i'm hoping to figure out. like i'm very sure. okay, that wasn't the question. i just want you to picture one. oh, okay. that you'd like to have. okay. for an interview situation. yeah. now tell me why should you have this job? okay, so i guess the job i picked was just to listing like in like a venture capital where they like they listen to like a lot of awesome dishes and they decide like what to fund. and i think the reason why i want to have that or say why should or why i want to have that job. why should we hire you? okay, so why i should have the job is i think at my t i've gotten a lot of exposure to lots of different things. one is just through the breadth of my coursework. i guess i'm in two very different fields. one other is through my, i guess just interaction with people on campus. like being on class council, being involved in the current year. i guess i've seen like a lot of different groups of people and i guess i'm constantly around lots of just awesome people with awesome ideas and i really enjoy just listening to them. and then a lot of times i've helped people develop maybe like they have a goal mind their plan and i've helped them work through especially like sophomores or freshmen in the current year. like they're putting that plan in action. so i think that'd be a good candidate because like i've had experienced listening to ideas. i can identify problem areas because i have a lot of experience executing those ideas. so again, both see what might be a good idea both technically as well as to see if there's a good plan to set forth and actually get it done. excellent. well thanks for interviewing with us today. thank you.",AGGR,5.31955134377,4.94449030095,5.16659354873,5.5531108433,5.1590873908,5.53980986624,4.96464321581,4.85419639407,3.7069987238,5.52960645867,4.96039937388,4.18887152001,4.37642746289,4.97716728861,5.31711509234,5.71085908107,5.99229280996,4.969158848,91.2303795629
p44," please tell me about yourself. okay. my name is evan ammore. i'm a junior here at mit in computer science. originally from blueville, kentucky. and, yeah, i currently live across the river in germany. i heard about this study through email, so i checked it out. i lived in louisville. am i great? you did. yeah. yeah. nice. anyway, so can you tell me about time when you served as a leader? a leader? sure. a good example of that would be some of my extracurricular work activities. so i'm involved in two activities in general that showcase my leadership skills. i was a camp cast on mit. i'm a student in the organization here on campus at mit. each summer, the organization puts on a summer camp for children and parents to have or have had cancer. and i served on the coordinator board for this organization. in the past, i was in charge of handling applications and contacting families of campers who would come to our camp and being in contact with them throughout the years and the newsletters and the updates playing the unions for them. this year, i am in charge of actually the students on campus and getting students to apply to become counselors for our camp and being a liaison with students. so i work as a coordinator. i usually have a co-coordinate. we usually work in tandem. the other activity is danish troop. another student organization here at mit where we put on a show each year, a dance, have some fun, a dance show. i'm a choreographer for that organization. so i lead the dance and teach people some dance moves to perform. that's all very helpful. so if you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and faced a challenge, how did you solve the problem? sure. i think a great example of that would be this past january. i participated in a web design competition here on campus, 647. i was on a team with my girlfriend and mutual friend of ours. it's always different working in a group with friends as opposed to just hanging out with them. there was a bit of conflict about how we wanted the website to go. we had different visions for how we wanted the website to look. i think for me, the best way that i handled that was to be willing to compromise. i think it's a very important skill and also just listening, happy listening. i was listening to why she wanted to make certain changes to the website. by doing that, i was able to figure out a common ground that we could work towards that we eventually did hit. and the way i would move forward with it. it's one conflict i definitely remember because it was pretty big at the time, but i didn't really get through it. so can you tell me about one of your greatest weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? okay. i'd say one of my bigger weaknesses is probably self-starting. it's something that i've been working on. it's like my goal for this year to work on. in the past, i would take my classes and really just do my schoolwork, but nothing really outside of the classes. there's one thing i've learned from being around all these amazing people here at mit. if you have an idea, just go for it. it's very easy, especially here, there's resources to do so. it's something that i want to work on. i've had some ideas for projects that i want to start on my own. it's always been an issue for me to actually get started on things. i come up with ideas and really dig it started on certain projects. but starting in iap, i plan on starting creating my own website and doing some ideas with that. and hopefully, i'll be getting some more experience in computer science. excellent. so, now thinking of a job that you'd like to be hired for, what do you think we should hire you? i think one of my best qualities is the ability to, very quickly, coming to mit, for example. i came to mit with very little experience in the field of computer science. many of my past internships have been thrown into fields where i did not have much experience. but i pride myself on the ability to grasp ideas quickly and build on top of those and use those to build solutions to problems. i find that after viewing some examples of a certain problem or just playing around with it for a little bit, i can get to work on using that sort of maybe technology or field. so, in the past couple of internships, i've had to deal with new languages, new frameworks. and i think that definitely more than compensates for any experience i'm lacking in. excellent. thanks again for coming in. no problem. thank you for having me.",AGGR,4.54177925324,4.52752307952,4.73797163543,4.69714695697,3.79197546054,4.74606515334,4.53077250139,4.23383359721,3.45017354256,4.51848839033,5.61226747567,3.34334245175,4.38128014733,6.35930487676,6.00652303676,5.4002982744,5.53481136665,4.91853944023,85.3320966401
p50," so please tell me about yourself myself well, i don't know how much you know from any sort of registration plus or anything. i'm ariane. i'm a junior right now. so i'm in my third year. i'm i guess it's to call mit south to talk about what i'm majoring. so i'm majoring in mathematics and physics and also dabbling in course six computer science and i'm thinking of getting a minor in french or french literature you grew up in the states in northern virginia growing up, i guess i was interested in i've played a lot of competitive chess i was also interested in recreationally and tennis and soccer and other forms of entertainment excellent so you tell me about time when you demonstrate leadership so in high school i was for my junior and senior years. i was captain of our chess team of my high school and we participated and so i mean people typically think of chess as an individual sport, but we participated in quite a few team events such as states which we won every year which would have been which we've been winning every year every year and all but also nationals which had until before i went there been kind of a little bit out of our reach you know, we used to go there and get maybe fifth or so but when i was there, i would manage to lead us almost the first we came in second three years in a row we came in first in blitz just speech chess under my leadership and i mean to be to be fair the people coming in were talented to begin with but but perhaps had you know, had they not had that environment we would not have done as well so it's a good time you're working on a team and you face the challenge i'm gonna be solved for all there were countless examples when we've been group projects in high school. there was one time when freshman year in high school working on a bit something called i bit integrated biology electronics and technology or biology english technology and we had a group project for people persons in the group and toward, you know a few days before the presentation we found with the person led them a decent bit of our data analysis had done it incorrectly and and he was not available. it was out of town at the time. so it was we didn't really know what had gone wrong, but he had come up with some results which were clearly you know could not be explained by by experimental error. there was clearly something he had done incorrectly. so we had to rush to to fix the what had been what had gone wrong and and to redo many of the tests which was a big challenge given time constraints and so we had to redevive the work in addition to what each of the remaining members had to do anyway and somehow to compile it for final presentation that's not like a life threatening challenge so can you tell me what your weaknesses and what are you doing to overcome it? i guess one weakness would be being very honest with myself in terms of trying to determine exactly what i want to do and focusing all my faculties on that rather than rather than trying to you're keeping one's options open. i think it's a good thing and but i think that sometimes it can be kind of it can be an excuse for not for not taking risks you know it so i think one issue and you know this was this is important because of the where i went to high school this culture was very person pervasive of trying to do everything and in great part, you know this causes you not to commit to any one thing which in one way could be good i guess in terms of your options open but on the other hand if you knew if you had known what you want to do specifically and had devoted all your resources to that specifically of course you would do better in that and in the end you're probably going to pick something so so i guess one one weakness is is trying to focus to be honest with myself about what specifically i want to do and to devote resources to that and what i'm trying to do to to to address that i guess it may seem at the beginning to be somewhat you know paradoxical but what i'm what i've been doing actually has been you know trying out a wide variety of things so i can you know so i can't use the excuse that you know there's a bunch of things that i don't really know yet so i should keep my options open i'll try them out and if i don't like them the ones that i don't like i'll drop so so that'll give me a way of deciding on what's left what's left will be what i like so now think which i thought you'd like to have why do you think we started? all right, so what's still early in terms of job search but one job that i would like that i'm considering is trading right there and trading or some sort of quantitative finance and i think i'll be strong candidate because i have an extremely strong quantitative background in mathematics and modeling computer science work done physics as well and i have a history of being competitive in both in an academic environment and in chess and in other sports and i always know especially if the world talking about is a trader trading i've always been interested in strategy games such as chess poker, etc trying to find an optimal strategy and use it to win and that i think is the skill set that's required for that kind of job most definitely thank you. this concludes our interview",AGGR,5.39458815516,4.96311876101,4.64992164022,5.33320291747,3.99416567885,5.24954681714,4.39138778712,4.77527695183,4.2336924175,3.98733903052,5.07684602876,4.39597807428,5.02627199859,6.61158388961,6.25880204962,5.37411816971,5.54316917237,5.43641444127,90.695423981
p78," tell me about yourself. i'm a junior in computer science. what sort of things do you want to know about me? anything. i like programming and python. i haven't been in computer science that long because i used to be a chemistry major. but i've been taking computer science classes for the past year and a half. great. so tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. i'm the president of my acapella group. so i have to organize publicity things. like when we have a performance, i have to make sure that everyone knows about the performance. so we have an audience and organize details like the reception and the getting a room reserved. okay. tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? time when i was working on a team. i guess if i could count my acapella group as a team, because i guess it is. there are times when we've had conflicts about whether we want it to sing a specific song. for instance, oftentimes there would be a song that we really liked, but it would take a lot of rehearsal time so we didn't think it was worth learning it because we had limited time. so we had to resolve the conflict by discussing different options. so i think we finally ended up deciding to sing the song in a future semester. we would still be able to sing it, but it wouldn't compromise the rest of our repertoire. okay. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? hmm. i can only think of things that were weaknesses. sorry. i guess i have trouble being criticized because i've always been sensitive. when i get criticized by people who aren't as sensitive, then they react more strongly to their criticism than they intend me to. so i have to learn to realize that some people who aren't as sensitive will criticize more harshly. why should we hire you? because i'm excited to work at facebook and because i'm motivated to do things in computer science because i find it really fun.",AGGR,4.64231431965,4.73115657333,4.63473179131,4.80953897288,4.87405749468,5.32683262155,5.33905789165,4.47908460956,5.36451738309,5.29175365885,5.71268617099,4.12014581192,4.32581402037,4.80321754184,5.10236255167,5.3932381227,5.59464185481,4.312851643,88.8580030339
p3," so, how are you? good, and you? i'm well. thanks for coming. yeah, sorry, i think i was late. i totally messed up. i thought we were at the media lab. it's okay. so please tell it by yourself. so, i would say that the job i'm interviewing for, let's say pound's here. yeah, so i'm chase, and i guess, i don't know, i really enjoy computers and outdoors. that's generally what i give people. so, in both of these, and computers mainly, at mit, i think some of my favorite classes have actually been graphics and computation photography as well. so it's actually been really interesting to me getting into harder problems, like really deep programming like c. i'm actually getting more interested in, whereas before when i came to mit, i had no idea about this stuff, and i just did a lot of web development. otherwise, i just really enjoy working on random projects, going to hackathons a lot and hanging out with people. yeah, just building cool things. otherwise, my main thing i do outdoors is ultimate frisbee, which i really enjoy. so, tell me about your time when you demonstrated leadership. actually, that would probably be it. i would actually put this on frisbee. so, i started the frisbee club in my high school, my junior year, and basically it was just a bunch of my friends, we used to play around a lot, and we said, hey, why don't we actually make this a team, we'll spell like 15 or 20 of us. so, i became captain, and what that entailed was getting people to practice every day, or maybe three times a week, depending on how people's schedules were. but it was definitely tricky because we had to get at least 15 people out on the field to be able to actually play a game because you need seven on each side. so, getting all this organized every day was definitely pretty hard to do, and i had to get people passionate enough to be wanting to play every time that we needed to play. and by the end, we went to a tournament in texas, which is where i'm from, and we got fifth my junior year and third my senior year, which is great without a coach or anything. just a lot of playing around with friends. so, tell me about a time when you were on a team and were faced with a challenge. how did you overcome it? okay, so let's go with robotics. it was one of the classes i was in last semester. so, basically, the first half of the class was just learning in general about robots and figuring out, you know, just like all the electronics first of all, and then actually the computer science behind it doing vision and such. so, finally, at the very end of the class, we had to make our own robots. and so, what i did there, basically, we had a few meetings to be able to figure out exactly what type of robot we were going to be building and stuff. and i guess what i wanted to do was basically go ahead with everything we'd already done and just push forward with that and just finish off, basically. and then what my team members wanted to do was actually redo everything and start from the very bottom. so, what we ended up doing, i actually took their side and it worked out very well. we had quite a few tricky problems involved. like, one really cool thing that we worked on was figuring out exactly how the robot can see the world. and what we had with this, we had a tile floor that we kind of cheated with. we had a tile floor and then walls everywhere. so, what we were able to do is say, let's just color the tile floor and wherever the coloring stops. so, let's look at all the white in the picture and whenever we don't see any white, that's actually the bottom of the wall. yeah, so then we basically took all these points that existed that represented roughly the bottom of the wall and then basically ran that through an algorithm that created it, turned it into a line. so, yeah, that was kind of what it was and it worked really well. in the end, we actually had this vision turned on which was really tricky and i think the first time they actually had something like this instead of just looking for balls and doing path planning, actually relocalization in the world. so, tell me about one of your weaknesses and how do you plan to overcome it? okay, one of my weaknesses. i would go with... yeah, i should have a better answer for this question. yes. i don't know if i can plan to overcome it. i would actually say i wish i was a lot better in working in teams. so, i actually really enjoy working in teams in general and that's actually been one of my biggest focuses at mit because i just know everyone's really great at everything. but being able to basically inspire people to do stuff that i think is a good idea, i have found that i'm not the best at, basically. i would just like... just various aspects of just everything, you know, like working in this social club where we just throw events in general for students and i've got various ideas that i need to get across to people but sometimes people don't agree with me and either have to be persuasive or something or come up with better ideas. so, i guess my plan to overcome this so far has basically just been a lot of practice. just doing the work. basically, again, like i've been doing a lot of teamwork in general. i do really enjoy it. so, i think it just comes with practice and being very conscious about how other people do stuff very well and inspire me. so, hopefully, i can inspire others. now, why do you think we should hurry? i guess because... i would probably say the one word comes down to passion. whatever i'm doing, i make sure to do it with everything that i have and i'm basically always thinking about the problems that i'm working on. i generally have a pretty small scope of problems as well that i always try and narrow down. i can't take so many problems at the same time and try and solve all of them. if i'm reading a book, i'm only reading one or two books. but with this, i don't know, i've found it so far to be really helpful. i think my passion generally overflows to other people. i think i'm frequently jumping around when i'm doing stuff and explaining stuff and listening to people. so, i think i bring some liveliness to places and also with this passion goes i'm always looking at new stuff, learning new stuff and teaching people about it and just enjoy making stuff. well, thank you. appreciate your interview with us today.",AGGR,4.41489217175,4.43306990037,5.01043000317,5.61607593418,5.60158567429,5.42686147714,6.06217275172,5.01628608696,3.33245849049,6.50032877227,4.79154954828,5.62123092399,3.9121988684,4.47653726578,5.52121455482,5.54982872237,6.01496032424,4.92355043543,92.2252319056
p79," so how are you doing today? good. tell me about yourself. i'm from mumbai, i'm a junior in course 6. i finally got ready to work with my children and wanted to do a work. i thought i'd do chemical engineering but got super interested in a bunch of stuff and finally decided to go to course 6. i've researched the media lab before now and working at blitz which is over in stato. i've been involved with engineers a lot of borders here and a bunch of other clubs like energy club and organizing the energy conference and the 100k and the bookshop. in general i'm super interested in entrepreneurship and computer science, like certain aspects of computer science really interest me as well. yeah, i'm just new to the world. great. tell me about the time you demonstrated leadership. sure. so, well, this is the most recent example i can think of but as a freshman, i still am pretty excited about international development. i joined mujino's world borders as it was a project called shower jean. it wasn't formally affiliated with ewb usa but we decided to take it on because we wanted, so we were building low cost, easy to set up showers we use in kenya. it was basically something that i'd never done before because there's computer science people, you know, generally don't deal with the real world. so, that was a great thing for me to get involved with and that summer i went and traveled with them to kenya and that was a great experience. so, coming back i was sort of elected as the leading the next year's student. that was a great thing because it's important to kind of realize that you might not have all the answers that that's fine, even you want to be teams, etc. but it was like despite not knowing anything about mechanical engineering, i was able to sort of understand and sort of graduate to eventually become taking on leadership with that community. great. and tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? yeah, tons of times. so, we had this house called 21w789 which is basically you make a mobile app and you sort of pretend as if it's something that you're actually making for industry. and there were four people on our team to heavily experience programmers. there was me who was kind of like i know how to do it but you know i could do it with more instruction. there was someone who was just starting out, she was a freshman that year. but she was great and we decided to make this app where when you have two iphones you can swipe, like you can bump them and whatever's on one phone, they sort of appeal on the other. and like you can mirror web pages, you can split them. and it was something that we hadn't done before, not a ton of people had done it. and at the media lab there was this technology that was recently sort of invented called swipe. they just swiped from one with the other and we thought that would be really great. and it was someone like a student like us who had done that. but we didn't realize that it was not production.ed and we'd have all these bugs and stuff and we'd have no documentation to go to. but there was this one person on the team being the awesome programmer he has insisted on going that way. when we met the founder of swipe he was like you know what, just don't use it. it's not optimized for the stuff that you guys are sending across, like the data. so we had this sort of tip when the rest of the team wanted to move on to do the same project using the bump api which is kind of standard documentation. whereas it would be infinitely cooler to do swipe, we just didn't have the resources at the time. so he was really experienced and you can't even say you don't know what you're doing. because he didn't know what he was doing. so eventually you were able to convince him that we should probably go with whatever we wanted and as a team instead of make it all democratic etc. so there was definitely a challenging situation because he's great, he's smart, and he's super nice and you don't want to offend anyone, especially when they are friends. you have to get the work done. right, right, right. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? is this a technical weakness or a general weakness? okay, a lot of times this is something that coding has taught me that i haven't quite learned. whenever you're in dallas just go ahead and do stuff. but for me i like to think about the entire algorithm or how exactly i'm going to use what before i start coding. which is the problem because sometimes new solutions come along the way that you haven't thought of. you can like iterate fast. it's okay if stuff doesn't work the first time. whereas i kind of want to research everything before i start doing stuff. that's sometimes an issue because then i can't do it as fast, especially if there's something new. on the other hand sometimes if it works it works really well because i've done my homework. but in general i like to just get my hands dirty and do stuff. why do you think we should hire you? well because a year ago i didn't know how to code at all. and now like next semester i'm going to finish up my degree as a junior. then i'll probably do math or something else. but that just kind of shows you that i'm willing to learn and i'm not afraid of trying new stuff. this technology will always change. i'm sure if i don't know php today you might not even use it tomorrow. but i think what's really important is that i'm willing to learn. and i work well with the team. i also like working by myself. so there's a good balance of what stuff is in. yeah, just hanging out with great people and doing great work. great.",AGGR,4.82698392841,4.84516165703,4.95012536989,5.93571972131,5.5047386594,4.61754428226,5.99791303749,5.04899580341,4.09771465943,6.50081710451,4.9884801945,5.03357609973,3.79439931967,4.58222379238,4.95652619884,5.29094368833,6.4412252702,4.40843258835,91.8215213751
p45," so how are you? pretty good. how are you? i'm well. so can you please tell me about yourself? okay, so my name is bonnie. i'm a junior at mit in course six, which if you don't know, i was a professor in computer science. i'm minoring in economics, also mathematics. so i'm interested in application of data and quantitative reasoning to any sort of interesting field. so that includes economics, finance, biology. so it's a very wide array of interests. and i'm here today because, well, i was told that it would be a good time here. data research. excellent. i'm on my team myself. oh wait, what year were you? 06. okay. anyway, so i'd like to ask you a bit about your leadership experiences. can you tell me about a time when you served as a leader? okay, so i'd say one fairly informal instance actually was over this past spring break. a couple of friends and four of us actually, it's a fairly small group. we biked from philadelphia to boston over spring break because we thought that'd be a good idea, whether it actually was. there were some amazing ups and amazing downs. definitely a very, very memorable experience. and there were just some points over the course of the trip when it was, you know, 45 degrees, except your biking and the, you know, state highways, raining. and like, we felt like giving up a little bit. you just heading back up, taking the train. and i really riled people up in terms of reminding us why we were doing this, reminding us of the fact that we're already 60% of the way through. we might as well, you know, push on all the way to the end of our journey. and just like, i guess evoking everyone's different motivation, because everyone, you know, wants to do something awesome, but everyone has a slightly different motivation for why they joined the team in the first place. and i guess providing like individualized reasons and individualized motivations to, you know, different parts of our team as to why they came on the first place and why that still resonates with them. and using that, you know, i was able to get the group back together. and we did bike all the way back up here. so that was a very rewarding experience. excellent. so can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and faced another challenge? how did you resolve it? sorry, what challenge? another challenge. just not that particular one. oh, another challenge. yes. well, most of the challenges i've seen coming in sort of teamwork, right? involved either internal challenge, something that's coming from within the team or an external challenge. so i guess if we were to talk about an external challenge, something not evolving, you know, lack of motivation, it would, let's see. so my freshman year, i was involved in disorganization on campus called tech fair, where we basically organized a tech expo at the beginning of the school year. and i was, again, i was able to motivate people towards the end when there was a lot of work happening, a lot of, you know, 12-hour days to get the logistics down before the event. and i guess, again, there, it does come down to really motivating people, speaking to their individual, you know, passions to get them to, you know, do things which they might not want to in a short time. excellent. can you tell me about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to overcome it? my greatest weakness, i've noticed, can be a lack of focus, especially that i have like a large number of tasks. it's very easy to, instead of, you know, caching away all my other tasks somewhere and focusing on one at a time, it's very easy for me to, you know, pop one out but still have, you know, like some tasks of the other things that have to do running in the back of my mind. so, of late, i've been trying to basically get more organized. i've, you know, had this hypothesis that if i use, you know, google calendar, google this, google that, all these other products to try to, you know, serve as fairly intelligent places where i can hash away my other tasks, it'll provide me with something which is very trustworthy that i will trust enough to not worry about those tasks because what usually happens, i just have to write down a piece of paper. i don't trust that i'll be able to find it and, you know, the risk of forgetting to do something important is pretty great to bear. so that's been pretty useful so far. i've noticed that i've had an urge sometimes to think about other things i have to do but i just reminded myself that, wait, wait, you wrote that down there. you probably knew what you were doing so don't worry about that. there's the supervisor, which is yourself, taking care of your other tasks. oh, that makes sense. so thinking about a job that you'd like to have, why should we hire you for this job? so i think that one thing i do retain in addition to, well, like i said, i've had this, what used to be a problem in terms of being able to focus on a task, but it does come with the added benefit of being able to juggle lots of tasks at the same time. i know lots of people who do focus on one task. it often becomes, you know, one task, one project going on for, you know, a couple months becomes the forefront of their thought, their imagination, becomes what they can handle. however, having been accustomed to juggling lots of stuff in the past, i think one great skill i can bring to the table is provided very, very agile member to the team who can juggle lots of different projects and bring insight to all of them without, with my newfound organization abilities, getting too caught up in the mix. excellent. well, thank you again for coming. thank you very much for talking to me.",AGGR,5.57853469676,5.65863925881,5.1935290484,5.63772933447,5.45162637945,6.15395722016,5.65920396147,4.84907391848,5.03498260143,5.90049659796,5.82350534907,5.8251552116,5.16626547469,4.84524050227,5.03624900071,5.81793097133,5.7345552918,5.19953153459,98.5662063535
p86," so, please tell me about yourself. um, like where i'm from, that type of stuff, but... okay, um, junior mit, uh, come from south florida, born and raised, so... cold weather's kind of rough for a guy like me, but that's alright. it's kind of a nice break from the heat of south florida. um, i've been playing music ever since i was four, so that's kind of been a big part of my life. um, but music tech, i mean, technology obviously, also. so, um, course two here, which is mechanical engineering, but i'm also dabbling in electrical, looking along the sides of control, that type of stuff, robotics, if you will. and just had one of my, like my second or third robot, finished last week, which was a freaking nightmare, but you know, it's okay, it's done, you know, it was a good time, so yeah, that's what i do. yeah. um, i guess that's, that's good for you. that's good, that's good. excellent. robot building is always a fun pastime. yeah. so, can you tell their time when you demonstrate leadership? leadership? um, well, i guess i'm usually pretty calm and collected, so if i ever notice, like, in a group setting of someone's, like, you know, there's some disagreement between the two, like in my robotics group, for example. the two guys, they're best buds, but they often, like, just get really heated, like, you know, like, fu, like, why don't we just do this and that type of stuff, so, in order to, like, keep it going, being productive, you know, someone has to be like, you know, just, guys, just calm down and, you know, keep doing that. so that's, that's, like, just, here and there, not really, like, super, like, i'm in control, but you know, at least, you know, saying, guys, we need to calm down and take a step forward. i feel like that's a little minor leadership role we gotta take there. other leadership roles, i play in a group, like a band, jazz group, so i often, you know, we all gotta get together and, like, kind of talk, any group setting, which i'm often in, i have to, like, you know, somebody has to take control, and i don't often take control initially, but, you know, if something is not going in a certain direction, or the right direction, i often feel like, maybe, can push it there very subtly, so leadership in a very subtle way, but not in, like, a band, i'm telling you what to do. anyway, that's, that's what i like to do. that makes sense. so, telling your time, when you worked on a teaming you faced a challenge, how did you go about solving it? um, okay, so, for example, the robotics group, um, we worked very last minute, it just happened to be one of those things where, like, we were all busy with other things, and we didn't really think about the scheduling, like, when it was actually, the project was actually gonna be due, so, basically, we all had to work really hard last minute, and, of course, you know, things don't always go according to plan, so we, like, we tried to build one thing, you know, machine something, and it ended up not being perfect the first time, so we have to go back and redesign it, or remachine it, so we had to do a couple, you know, remachine a few things a couple times, and, you know, it's like six in the morning, you've been working in lab for, like, 13 hours, you gotta keep going, so you gotta stay positive and keep, you know, even though you may not finish, or, like, you know, you kinda, you can't really think about not finishing, you just have to go for it and keep finishing, you know, keep working, eventually, you know, with the mindset that you are going to finish, so that's, i guess, adversity in that way. just, you know, always stay positive and keep looking towards the future, keep working. yes. so, you tell that one of your weaknesses, and what you've done to try to overcome it? so, time management is one of my weaknesses, which is not always the best to admit in an interview, but, you know, whatever, that's alright. what i've been doing to get better about it is, you know, sometimes you gotta look like, even a week in advance, i've discovered, especially at mit, isn't as far, you know, it's not as far as you need to go, so, like, this week, for instance, i had, like, three exams, like, a final robot project, another presentation i had to take care of, you know, a lab, a couple of p-sets, like, you just, i didn't realize how much work was coming up until, like, last thursday or something like that, which is when i started working, even then, you know, i didn't have enough time, i really should have started working, you know, monday on it, when i was just relaxing, i was like, oh, you know, i got p-sets due this week, but i can really relax and be alright. so, in terms of improving that, just, you know, gotta write up a schedule and look really far in advance to make sure i, you know, really see what's coming. yeah, so i've been trying, i've been being better. i started off, you know, a start of college where, like, i didn't see things for, like, three days in advance or two days in advance, and now it's kind of in, like, a week, week and a half, i'm looking in advance. so, i'm getting there, slowly but surely. and now, think of a job you'd like to have. okay. do you want to mind? yeah, sure. so, what should we hurry? for that job you mean. yeah. um, i feel like i know what i'm doing now. i'll say there was a point in time where i didn't feel like i knew what i was doing, and i've been one of those guys that, like, you know, you can apply to a job and say, you know, yeah, there's no harm in applying, which i've kind of figured out eventually. yeah, there is no harm in applying, i agree. but at the same time, i feel like there's kind of like an obligation to actually know what you're doing for that job, and right now i feel like i know what i'm doing. at least a lot more so than i did last year or even last semester. so, at the rate i'm going, i feel like, you know, another semester of classes that i'm taking, i'll really know what i'm doing, and then some more time in the field or at the job, i'll piece together and actually feel pretty confident. so, that's why, i guess. well, thank you. yeah. i appreciate your coming today.",AGGR,4.47483851696,3.95926002144,4.78907144132,5.53581365638,5.24584067598,5.49785539635,5.94144226619,4.92152637072,3.76396816111,6.09577253947,5.65432133432,5.35606102632,3.24920388012,5.22898627567,5.29480464061,5.00418910267,6.09864351335,4.9330399308,91.0446387498
p69," so, tell me about yourself. so, i'm, i guess i was born in d.c. i lived in maryland until i was seven. and my parents decided to be a good idea for me to go to nigeria, which is where i'm from. and i lived in the next seven years of my life there. and i came back to america for a junior-engineer year of high school. and so i did that. and so, well, like during that period, i sort of found interest in mechanical engineering. and so i decided to apply to mit. so, it was the best engineering school. and i got accepted here now, junior year. yeah, excellent. so, can you tell me about time when you acted as a leader? i acted as a leader. well, in my, when i'm classed, i'm taking the semester. it's a 212, introduction to robotics. and it's a, the lab portion of the class is a group project. and so there are four people. and there has to be a team leader, sort of to get everyone organized here on the same page. everyone knows what's going on. and i sort of volunteered myself as a leader. and it's been, it's actually been much harder than that, just working with different people who want to do different things, i guess, for this project. and so just organizing everyone and sort of focusing everyone has been an interesting challenge. can you tell me about time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge? so perhaps the challenge you're talking about, how did you go about resolving? i asked for my, you know, other class, i'm taking this semester actually, design and manufacturing. there's a group of eight people and we're tasked with designing and manufacturing a hundred ilios. and so i guess the prerequisite to this class was, design and manufacturing one where we had to make one robot and sort of, that was more individual. but here we're tasked with, the big thing here is manufacturing. and so i, it's easy for everyone to want to decide to design this ioya, but you have to sort of consider the manufacturing aspect, like how easy would it be to make, since we're making a ton of them. and so this was a challenge, sort of getting everyone to agree on one sort of design idea. and i sort of, i brought up, i made it, i should have let everyone know that it wasn't just a design that we're worrying about, it's also, and more so the manufacturing in this case. interesting. sorry then. so can you tell me about one of your greatest weaknesses and what you're doing to try to improve on it? so i'm not, i'd say i like public speaking, but i'm not very good at it. and so i say that's one of my biggest weaknesses. and sort of working on it hasn't been hard, that's because it's something i like doing. and so, like, given opportunities, i try to be the leader of a certain group. that way i talk to, i'm talking to the whole group a lot, that sort of helps by speaking. and just like in class projects, particularly humanities, i try to focus on taking ones where there's public speaking involved, and not just writing essays and things like that. cool. a lot of fun course 21 courses here. so now i'd like you to think of a job that you'd like to have. okay. do you want to mine? yeah, sure. good. okay. so now, why do you think you should have this job? because i am, i have a junior here at mit, and this is the place to find sort of the best engineers, or some of the best engineers in the world, a student sort of intern. and i think i do a great job at your campus company, sort of because of the experience i have previously, and the knowledge, or combining that with the knowledge that i'm getting here at a work class institute. i think that makes me well qualified. yeah.",AGGR,3.77064029362,3.78881802224,3.77839634854,3.83471519111,3.12548133767,4.51216470354,4.10451675542,3.28791212995,3.81650931336,4.01396863511,6.07561962461,2.57476913898,4.0394536969,6.1047731091,6.0385258973,4.2607121295,5.28524766446,3.86887493106,76.2810989225
p55," so tell me about yourself. so i'm a junior at mit, a math major. i have experience in both the economics side of things and cs, some coding. interested in going into probably analytics or training in the future. tell me about how you demonstrate a leadership. so i'm involved in the undergraduate study of women in math. and one of the most recent activities we've been doing involves an outreach project for middle school and high school girls, where we bring them together and have them all do a collaborative math event, as opposed to normal competition math. so i spearheaded the project to do that. it was originally aimed for just local boston girls. so we did all the publicizing for that. we ended up getting a lot more publicity than we expected. people came in from california and stuff. oh, wow. tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? ok. so i guess i'm also a member of china development initiative. and so a lot of times when we were at events, most of them are within our own group. so brainstorming for service leadership programs, stuff like that. but we also try to do some events where we bring in professors and other speakers. so some of the biggest challenges we face will include actually finding these speakers, getting them to really correspond with us. sometimes the little person will be like, oh, we're interested. but then they just don't follow up. so going after them and looking for that response. sure. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? ok. i would say i'm generally more of a passive person. so if someone gives me a task, i'll do it. i won't really. like if i get stuck, i'll kind of try to keep working on it myself instead of asking for help. so i've been trying to, i guess, talk to more, like, higher ups if i run into issues or ask more questions, i guess. great. why do you think we should hire you? we be in this company that does analytics. i think i would bring a lot to the team in terms of teamwork in addition to the qualifications i have academically speaking. i guess i would say that i have a lot of experience working in teams, a lot of experience in the analytics side of things as well, as well as a pretty interdisciplinary background in general. so i'd be able to bring a lot more, i guess, directions to the team. great.",AGGR,4.88530504599,4.65076145587,5.07812937582,5.44399679136,4.31819144804,5.4009435076,5.29202715735,4.5068489508,3.24693758543,5.58483008312,5.52625784302,4.88088773274,4.72967036809,5.0102162925,5.34839609633,5.79677863136,6.0092699977,4.91458151004,90.6240298731
p6," so please tell me about yourself. well my name is jeff. i was born in japan. i lived there for seven years before i moved to the us first to michigan for two years and then to maryland and it was when i was in high school or sorry middle school that i was exposed to a lot of different math science advanced science courses on this where i was exposed a lot of math competitions and neuroscience competitions and it was around my junior year in high school sorry okay it was around my junior year in high school where because of peer and parental pressures i decided to be pre-med i decided to pursue a career in medicine so it was during high school i decided taking the biology classes genetic cell physiology and when i got here to mit i decided to major in course 20 and after about four lab positions two in academia and two in the industry i realized course 20 and the medicine track wasn't for me mainly because it was a quantitative enough or competitive enough or fast-paced enough for me but during my last internship at a biotech industry i had the privilege of talking to talk with several psych directors it was because of them through that meeting i realized that i might be more into finance and it might be more suitable for me and after which i started to have those and colleagues some finance majors and that's why i'm here. tell you about time when you demonstrated leadership. i would say it was during high school there was this one group sophomore year we had to do this mission this project called mission possible where we had to design a rover that would traverse a platform and record some data. the problem with the group was there wasn't supposed to be a leader but nobody really took any responsibility in doing what they had to do and that was partly due to the fact that nobody was assigned these individual team members were not assigned anything so i decided to take the initiative a couple days before it was due was actually a three week project to become the leader the unofficial but self-claimed leader and as a leader i assigned tasks to people politely i asked could you do this because this was a very multi-perspective project that required programming construction and engineering and yeah i took i decided to be the leader i assigned tasks and i would say we were pretty successful by the time it was due. tell me about time you were working on a team that were faced with a challenge how did you solve the problem? okay well i would like to talk about my past and my very most recent summer internship at a biotech company and the problem i think it was an individual problem that i was working with was that because i was working with cells and cells the way cells work is that you culture them on monday let's say day one and you let them grow until day four or five or six and then you collect data and the problem is you're not you can't collect data from day one and five you have to collect it on day six and if anything happens on day three or day four or sometime between day one and day five the data will make no sense and you would have to restart the experiment and i was on a tight schedule and this was a 10 week project and i'm on the first two weeks i contaminated the cells both weeks and so my data had to be redone my experiment had to be redone and the problem was that this was a 10 week project and now i had eight weeks to do. well one thing i learned in that internship is to not panic when situations like such arise and what i did was i went to people for help and i definitely spent more hours i talked to the hr department i talked to my managers to increase my hours weekly hours from 40 to 60 so instead i worked saturdays and sundays in fact there was this one point where i worked 23 days in a row and successfully i think finished in fact after my data analysis and their compiling i presented my data to the site director who told me that i had the most impressive presentation out of all of the 21 interns there so yeah it was during challenges like that it was because of challenges like that i've learned to not panic in a stressful situation and to definitely branch out for help. tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it. i think one of my weaknesses is i don't have formal education finance i decided to be course 20 i decided to pursue pre-med and it was a very i probably agreed that it was a very sudden transition to math course 18 but i think i make up for that at least partly by going to workshops going to reading books and definitely networking with colleagues so in terms of the financial models the mental math skills and the programming skills that i need to know i believe i have a very strong grasp of those. now why do you think we should hire you? well i think compared to the rest of the competition nobody shows more initiative than i do and in fact i don't think anybody has the technical skills or the willingness to work such long hours. i think one of my strength is that i don't have any boss expectations because i had to do such a sudden transition in career i have to do a lot of research to convince myself that i won't do that. i have to do this transition again. like i said i've never got talked to by books i've done tons and tons of research. i've emailed out to site directors i've even emailed out to first year analysts and i know exactly what my job is. i know that the long hours are tough and anybody who says that they like the long hours will be lying to you and i know the exact skill sets that are required and i believe i have those skill sets. well thank you again for coming. thank you, thank you for this opportunity. yes it was great to meet you.",AGGR,5.10651231715,4.8314817722,4.86059472128,5.02038454713,4.64825935206,4.33180466888,4.19422667458,4.17489068485,3.92032941437,4.49537499283,5.02782250409,4.26198846721,4.82624462496,5.8289772252,5.82438987265,5.61942047508,5.3718582209,5.29597734086,87.6405378763
p7," so hi, i'm dr. powell. hi, i'm jacob. nice to meet you. so how are you doing? good. how are you? i'm well. thank you. so, please tell me about yourself. okay, i'm a junior at mit studying math and computer science. mm-hmm. and i'm looking for a summer internship at the company that summer... mm-hmm. tell me about time when you get into trade leadership. okay, so i'm actually currently president of two student groups on campus. the educational studies program, which runs large-scale educational programs with middle and high school students where they take classes taught by mit students. and the mit mystery hunt, which is a one-weekend event in january, where thousands of mit students and other community members come to campus to participate in a large, multi-day sort of puzzle competition. so i'd be happy to go into specifics about either of those, but i have plenty of stories to tell. tell you the time when you're working at a team and face the challenge. how did you solve the problem? okay, so one thing that comes to mind is a couple months ago, i was in a robotics competition at mit called maslab. so it's an autonomous robotics competition with you have to design, build, program the robot from scratch. and i was in charge of programming the robot for the other team. and we ran into several problems with the vision libraries we were trying to use in order to sort of track the balls and the field elements just weren't working for us. and we spent probably the first half of the month trying to get these to work for the other team. and eventually just decided that it would be easier for us to start from scratch and write everything out ourselves. so sort of by throwing out the assumption that we should work with the code we were given and starting from those principles, we were able to actually get a vision to be at a level above most of the other teams because we could sort of custom write the code to be specific to the task at hand rather than trying to adapt to general libraries. tell me one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome them. okay. i guess one of the weaknesses i found is that i tend not to know when to ask for the help. so for instance at my internship last summer this is something that my mentor pointed out to me several times where i would sort of if i got stuck in a problem would you know for this try to see what i could do about it. you know google around for the solution see if other people had encountered the same problem and then only after a couple days of trying to work around it then talk to someone. whereas you know if i just ask someone for the help for the first day they could say oh i ran into this problem last month because how you fix it and avoid me sort of this hassle of trying to google and figure it out on my own. so i definitely started to become more aware of this over the course of the summer and made a conscious effort to when i was having a problem you know look at my watch and figure out how much time i was wasting trying to solve it and if it got to be more than like half an hour on my own i would just poke someone next to me and ask them. i mean i think just sort of continuing that and trying to make sure that i'm keeping up the habit of ensuring that i'm not sort of getting stuff on my own should help. now why do you think we should hurry? okay that's an interesting question. i think so a lot of the candidates you've seen probably have come in with similar abilities you know students at schools like mit very you know top of the top of the class. so i wouldn't say there's much that differentiates me there but i would say that i think i would get along well with your company. you know people who have worked with me before have told me that i'm just sort of like a fun person to be on a team with. so if you sort of looked out to other aspects beyond just you know the numbers or gpa or what's on my resume and you know try to maybe you know if you want me to hang around hang out at the office for a couple days and you know work with you guys and we can see how that goes. i'm confident that you think i you would conclude that i would be a good fit here. well thank you for coming. any other questions? i don't know.",AGGR,5.79930374281,5.47346734645,5.20417664166,5.99873409383,4.88604973191,6.63154497837,4.79259662662,4.91447854325,5.92916127869,5.50456862011,6.04631607177,4.94138360782,5.57242669885,6.00791295588,5.73631808747,6.19747572924,6.26003506778,5.27204704397,101.167996866
p83," how are you doing today? i'm good. i'm good. good. tell me about yourself. so i'm a junior at mit, studying brain and cognitive science. i'm interested in studying cognitive neuroscience in the future, probably systems level. great. tell me about a tiny demonstrative leadership. okay. well, this past summer i was in china and i was helping out with this cognitive learning program. and what they do is they try to take principles, learn through research, and apply those in the classroom. and so we were applying those to students who were in sixth grade, trying to teach them english, and it was great. so i got to actually go there and teach a class of sixth graders for the whole summer. and they let me develop some of the curriculum, which is very cool. and it was a great experience. great. tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? okay. well, actually part of the same program, we were trying to put out videos of the teaching to give examples for other people. and none of us knew how to program or anything like that. and we were in china. so it was both a language barrier and also overcoming that knowledge gap of not knowing how to program. and what we ended up doing was trying to find a chinese student who was studying computer science in beijing. and the language thing did come into play, but eventually we were able to sort of get through that. it was a challenge all the way through. great. and can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? yeah. so i have trouble with getting up in front of people and talking, which is part of why i came to this interview. but also this semester i joined the debate team, which has been great so far. basically we go around to different colleges to return to. and we get up and we just speak for an hour. and that's really helped out so far. great. so why do you think you should get into graduate school? because i want to make a difference in this field. i'm very, very committed to this career path. i mean, i know this is what i want to do. there's really nothing else i can see myself in the future doing. i mean, i love it. i'm fully committed. and i'd like to make a difference here.",AGGR,5.84600327782,5.53718944681,6.08504610651,5.88471977888,6.07237803909,5.74527886013,6.54344447601,4.92479784023,4.41832716622,6.56263386472,6.30984737567,5.91289572283,5.37244412606,5.30453986363,5.84766850058,5.91981245352,6.38481691887,5.74026020682,104.412104024
p81," in order to learn more about like the pharmaceutical aspect of the brain. and so, i'm trying to give myself to the patent law. so, pharmaceuticals i guess. great. so tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. well, last semester i was a part of the mentor corps for a student organization on mit's campus called mfvs achievement. and one of the things, as part of the mentor corps, you have a small group of students that you want on one tutor and you act as their mentor and tutor. and you meet with them once a week for a five hour study session. and they're inner city high school students who may not have access to the best basic math and reading skills. so we meet once a week to go over what we're going to teach them and then we teach them the next day on a sunday. and so that's leadership in and of itself. but i also took the initiative to plan a sponsorship banquet to thank all of our very generous donors. and so, me and another member of the mentor corps planned a sponsorship banquet that i was told went very well. so, i'm very kind of involved. so tell me about a time you were working on a team that faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? well, i guess the one thing that i've learned working on several teams throughout my life is that communication is necessary. so, in high school i worked on a team and we have received a grant in order to build an alternative energy device. and there was a lot of issues amongst the different committees. so there was an electrical component and then there were people trying to build a floatation aspect of it because it was supposed to be in water. and there was people in the water proofing committee. and so, in terms of communicating deadlines and expectations, i think there was a sometimes there could be breakdown in that because everyone's busy. and you see that here and i saw it a lot in high school. and so, i was kind of managing everyone. and so, just being able to communicate the expectations to make it really apparent because i think we're around a lot of high achieving people a lot. so as long as they know what they need to do and what's expected of them, i think, at least for me as a high achieving person, once i know what i need to do, i can do it. and as long as that's communicated and clear, i think that's necessary to resolve a lot of problems. so, tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it. i'd say one of my weaknesses can definitely be in terms of organization. so if there's something i know that i need to do, i will definitely get it done. but in terms of parceling out the appropriate amount of time sufficiently beforehand, sometimes that can be lacking to where there can be times where i'm scrambling at the last second. and i'll always get it done, but it's just in terms of personal stress and maybe stress of people who want to see results over time versus at the end. but i've gotten a lot better at that, especially at mit because you really can't mess around with that kind of weakness. so just knowing my schedule the month beforehand versus the week beforehand and investing in a planner has definitely helped me a lot. great. and why do you think you should get to law school? i think because i've wanted to since i was 12 and i think i have a lot that i could give coming from mit. i have kind of a back, like the mindset of science and engineering and adding that into the sphere of law. i think it would introduce a unique problem-solving set and i could have a lot to offer to the community of lawyers across the nation.",AGGR,5.4967854764,5.55319382773,5.84916849292,5.39096766186,4.90786786953,5.33900086017,5.26504171858,4.56986662995,3.88038137961,5.60309079617,5.39465410323,5.21116141331,5.46399215651,5.63567827507,5.75700633906,5.71477411164,5.81316647553,5.55275103042,96.3985486177

p42," so, jaya, please tell me about yourself. so, i'm a junior at mit. i'm in aerospace engineering. i'm thinking of doing more of the aeronautics side rather than the astronautic side, but i don't have to decide till later. i'm in rotc and in the air force portion. i'm hoping to become a pilot. i applied pretty recently and i'll find out maybe in february or march of next year. i'm also in sigma alpha epsilon fraternity. our house is on bu's campus across the river and i've been living there since i was a sophomore. that's basically me. excellent. so, tell me about your time. what do you demonstrate leadership? so, probably the biggest chance i got to demonstrate leadership so far in my life has been this past summer when i went to pretty much rotc's version of bootcamp. it's called field training and it's about a month long and it's in alabama and it's pretty much a test to see what you do in really stressful situations. so, they give us pretty big things like we have to be in charge of 40 or 50 people and we have to make sure that they got to this place at the right time and then do i guess the correct action when we get there and make sure that nobody's going astray or making sure that all of the obstacles that the instructor set up, we can overcome them. so, being in charge of people for a good two or three days when everything is just so high stress is probably the most challenging leadership experience i've ever had. that's all very interesting. so, if you tell me about the time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge, how did you solve the problem? to give, i guess, a non-rotc related example. as we have a decent amount of projects in course 16, like unified, is very project based in the second semester and one of the biggest problems we had in our specific group was the way that i guess the work was being allocated. so, at first it was supposed to be very evenly divided so each person on the four person team would do a quarter of the work but some people started doing a little bit less and some people started doing a little bit more and by the middle of the semester it was very unequal. so, it was kind of getting under everyone's skin. so, as a group after we realized that it just wouldn't, it was really a detriment to our productivity. we all had a group meeting and said, listen, this is what we have to do. we have to reallocate the certain things that are at home or the parts of the project that we wanted to originally and it just kind of went astray. so, we did that and it became a lot better. excellent. so, you can tell me about the time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge, how did you solve the problem? working on a team faced with a challenge. i can think of trying to not hit the same categories. so, in essay, in the fraternity that i'm in, last semester i was the recruitment chair. so, the job for the recruitment chair is essentially to plan, rush, like plan our events for cvw, plan our events for fall rush, plan our events for spring rush for a full calendar year, or for a full school year, excuse me. and the question was challenges in a group, right? this was, tell me about the time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge. okay. how did you solve the problem? so, it's challenges in teamwork. so, challenges in teamwork. so, rush is very team oriented because you're trying to work with your brothers to really see, i guess, which freshmen are the most compatible with your fraternity and that you probably have the best time with. so, the way i set it up was we actually did work in small teams, about four or five brothers, and we'd go out and do fun things and meet freshmen. i would say the biggest problem with that during rush is that some teams were a lot more active than others, and the team that i was in was a little bit less active. and, of course, as being rush chair, i didn't want that to be the case. i wanted to change that. so, especially in situations where you don't have, you don't have hard given, not given, but like, outlined powers. like, you're not someone's boss, you're just like another brother in the fraternity. good. the best kind of way to convince people to do something that you want to do is through positive motivation. so, that's what i ended up using a lot for a while as rush chair to get people to go out. so, it was always like being very excited to do it and knowing that you're passionate about it and having them realize that, oh, this is like a really good thing that we should be doing and it'll really help us out and it'll be fun. so, that's how i set that problem. very good. so, can you tell us about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to improve upon it? so, my greatest weakness, i normally would probably have to think a lot more about, but i actually had a similar conversation with one of my bosses in rotc about a month and a half ago. so, i would say my greatest weakness is when i get put in really stressful situations. i will tend to jump to a decision or a conclusion too quickly and won't necessarily think about, or i won't think through the whole process, like too fruition. i'll kind of like hurry up and want to get to something so the situation can be, i guess, resolved. so, what i'm working on is just being able to, even in a stressful situation, and i know there's a problem, to kind of slow down and take a step back and really look at things kind of from a higher altitude. ah. ah, that's very good. so, thinking about a job that you'd like later, why do you think we should hire you for your position?

p4," so how are you doing? good. so please tell me about yourself. so i'm a junior studying aeronautics and astronautics at mit. so right now i'm currently in the middle of my junior year. i'm looking for a summer internship with a company. and tell me about time when you demonstrate leadership. so for example, last year when we were working on a class project where we were trying to design a jet engine for ge, i had to work with four people in trying to optimize certain parameters for this engine that we would have to present in some way to present to ge engineers. during that time one of my team members actually got really sick and he actually had to go to medical for a couple of days and he wasn't really able to do much. and another person ended up, i wasn't showing up very much. so during that time i sort of basically had to facilitate the people who weren't sick and basically help them communicate, talk to each other and set up meetings. i sort of took the helm on towards the end on a lot of that and basically got everybody together to complete this project. telling you about a time when you were working on a team and we're faced with a different challenge. how did you solve that problem? so over the summer i was working at auburn university. i was doing uav at collision avoidance algorithms. i was working with a program to allow a whole bunch of uavs to find the same airspace to basically get to their objectives without crashing into each other. i was working with a partner but in a larger context of a dozen students. as it turns out the challenge in this case was that although it was sort of like programming, ai, sort of aeronautics project, my partner came from a mechanical engineering background and didn't really have any programming experience nor had an actual experience with sort of uav design. so that became a bit of an issue. but i think basically what ended up happening was i worked with a grad student there and all the people to basically bring her up to speed, basically sort of teacher programming from the ground up up to level where she might feel the help with programming like an ai for a uav. and in that case i drew upon a lot of resources that are available there. you know, the grad students who are helping us, the professors in charge of the project, as well as the other students in the program. so what are your weaknesses and how do you plan to overcome it? so i think one of my weaknesses is that i have a tendency to show up to things kind of late. this is actually probably after i'm used to going to a certain place because i have a tendency to think, especially in the mornings, because i have a tendency to think, oh, i can get to a certain place by biking at a certain speed. so i think what i tend to do, what i'm trying to do nowadays to try to overcome that is basically get to somewhere beforehand and then basically do work there, as opposed to try to do work away from a place where i need to be and sort of try to make it there in the nick of time. this is something i've been trying to implement over the past couple of weeks. now why do you think we should hire you? i think you should hire me because basically i've demonstrated over the past couple of years a fair amount of research experience, a fair amount of experience in and out of the classroom in both sort of an academic setting and in a research and development setting such that i think i would be an asset to your company. i think that's my past experience with both software and hardware, so i think the hardware side of aeronautics and astronautics makes it so that i have a good balance that would be useful to you.",AGGR,4.49449445111,4.5301287215,4.5007070313,5.49449445111,4.26134323401,3.8578483967,4.85215010808,4.73800014854,3.11144466161,5.36988386167,5.17744701629,4.39273648876,4.68837924196,5.06519019504,5.56608366997,5.3241358317,5.65836395517,4.45290867925,85.5357401438
p43," so can you tell me about yourself? sure. so i'm a senior at mit in management and computer science. really interested in the intersection of the two. so not just how computers can, like, the best algorithms to do about computers, like inventing the next div algorithm or the next compression algorithm, not really something that i'm that interested in doing. but really finding how computers can help apply to people's lives and make new businesses or improve existing businesses. that's really what i'm interested in. excellent. let me open my questions up here. so can you tell me the time when you demonstrated leadership? sure. so i guess i'd say earlier this year. so i'm actually the president of baker house. and earlier in the beginning of the year at mit, we had this process called recs, residence exploration, where all the norms try and throw events and somehow recruit or retain the freshmen that they have. and the recs event that we had, we threw a bunch of events, had about 10 workers that we were able to give early arrival to, so free housing. so we ran about five or six events, the largest of which was a party where we had over 700 people attend. so can you tell me the time when you're working on a team and faced a challenge? how did you go about resolving? sure. so i think there's always been challenges. so last summer, when i was at disney, there was some disagreement about how we should, when we should schedule, what week we should schedule the trial for. and there was some disagreement about whether we should have it later because of dates for when the program would be ready. but if we had it past a certain date, then we'd have to have the app also consider time zone issues. so basically just discussed with all the stakeholders and let them know that by changing this date, pushing it back, we're adding scope to the app, and we're going to have to make additional development changes and see if they would be able to be flexible to change it back. that makes sense. yeah. so tell me about your greatest weakness and what you've done to overcome it. sure. so i think the problem that i have the most is in delegating tasks to people. so i want to make sure that things are done properly. so i tend to overly control on things. so basically, i've been thinking to myself, is this something core that i really have to do? now i think let's get someone else to do it. and that way also they learn it. so when i graduate, they're able to take on that role. thanks. so i guess thinking about a job that you'd like to apply for, why should we hire you for this position? sure. i think i combine technical expertise with business expertise and product expertise. so hiring me as a product manager for your mobile app, i think, would be optimal because i have expertise in all these areas. and i've worked in all these areas in the past. and i'm able to bring that expertise to your organization in a way that i think few other candidates have. well, thanks for coming. thank you for having me.",AGGR,5.68396192871,5.62165683625,5.45243178228,5.92414801388,5.05420031047,5.6433361895,5.12212752248,5.05883708804,4.54832456671,5.45432398408,5.54317278904,5.90262827442,5.56130636558,5.75199126911,5.57644356174,6.10445727005,6.20764520622,5.58169506967,99.7926880282
p57," so how are you doing today? i'm doing very well thanks how are you? good. tell me about yourself. i'm currently a junior pursuing a degree in both computer science and business and what's really drawn me to both of these is the fact that they involve a lot of problem solving and a lot of interpersonal dynamics a lot of interesting questions come up where it's a lot of actually thinking innovatively and that's why i've chosen to major both of these and actually that's why i'm interested in consulting is because it's a good application of the problem solving that i'm doing in both of those. tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. recently i was in a group project where each of us kind of had our own tasks to do and it was a very straightforward class project however there's i noticed a lack of communication the lack of set deadlines so in that case i kind of set up i organized communication between all of us i really got us on the same page and pushed us to reach our deadline and you know it's a good thing i started when i did because otherwise we would have missed the deadline. i've also had a lot of leadership positions if you want something a little bit more structured would you like me to tell you about one of those? yeah, okay. last semester i was an event director for my sorority and what i had to do for that the biggest event especially logistically fell under my responsibilities so i with a $2,200 budget organized a dinner event for 200 people in restaurants across boston so this involved finding places making sure all food allergies were taken care of really finding out what everyone in my sorority needed and wanted with their evening and this also involved a lot of delegation because you know there are about 20 restaurants involved i couldn't personally be in charge of all of those so i had to delegate out to a committee make sure they knew what was happening manage the risk aspect of it by keeping track of who had left who hadn't gone as yet everyone knew their reservations how to get there how to get back so in that case it was kind of a different style of leadership with more of delegation and things like that. and tell me about the time you were working on a team and faced a challenge how did you solve that problem? i guess the first thing that comes to mind is that same item i was just talking about where we weren't all on the same page and not communicating i can also try to think of something else if you don't mind giving me just a minute. sure. so i guess in one of my classes last year we had a team project where certain elements of it were things that none of the three of us on the team knew how to do or were particularly interested in learning how and the way we kind of resolved that issue because clearly as an aspect it needed to get done we resolved that by making sure the person who took that had less responsibilities elsewhere to kind of balance it out so the girl who took that was happy because her main priority was spending less time whereas for the rest of us we were more interested in the actual material so we found a mutually agreeable solution. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? yes. i think one of my weaknesses is that i tend to get very excited about everything i'm doing you know that like i'm a double major because i started in computer science and my own management really excites me too i want to do that as well which in the past has led me to kind of overextend myself a little bit which as a result when you're really excited about everything but then you try to do everything the amount of commitment you can give to each one is reducing but conscious of that this year i cut down a little bit on my extracurriculars especially because last year while doing all of those i wasn't sleeping as much which you know while i was still there and pulling my share in everything you know it's harder to be a full present member of anything if you're tired so this year i kind of focused in on the things that were most important to me and i'm aware of that so when i feel myself reaching my limit i'll actually try to prioritize more. and why do you think we should hire you? as i mentioned before what i'm studying in school is very applicable to consulting but in addition to that i'm really excited about the work that consultants do especially as i mentioned i'm very interested in a wide range of fields and with consulting you really get to explore a lot of those delve into them and in consulting i get to apply my favorite aspects of computer science and management both which is again the problem-solving the thinking innovatively these are all things that are very important to a consulting company and that is exactly what i love to do so i think i would have that passion and drive that makes every member of your company that i've spoken to really engaging and it seems from all my previous conversations with them they're really excited about this which is you know exactly what i would hope to bring as well.",AGGR,6.5809709482,6.64721816,6.39821320392,6.49244453357,6.14032684895,6.39249702013,6.41817429267,4.64177681993,5.76862920842,6.61158388961,6.42160996922,6.27907384787,6.02620075772,6.10896694446,5.98982758842,6.72840513159,6.06845525266,6.53731364872,112.251688066
p80," so how are you doing today? awesome. how about yourself? good. tell me about yourself. well, i grew up in berkeley, california. i've been interested in medicine my whole life. my dad worked for ucsf as a researcher but not as a doctor. and i would visit him at work and i was always attracted to the hospital side. not as much the lab side, although i do like research as well. great. so tell me about the time you demonstrated leadership. well, in high school i was capturing a golf team. and that was blast. golf, girls golf, is not super competitive. it's very haphazard and it's usually been one extreme or another. very bimodal. you've got these super serious girls who parents are on the course with them and they're going to be lpga. girls are not that up but i just goofed off with golf. berkeley high is definitely the ladder of that. so i coordinated this group of motley girls along with my coach. we had a lot of competitions where candy was the reward. we played a lot of games. had a really great time. but a big part of it was like, you know, there was a leadership aspect. we had to stay organized, especially because no one else was. and so like, maybe we made it to meets and like, organizing the snacks. maybe people showed up. tell me about the time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? well, i mean i can continue to say the same example because i didn't start off as captain. and it's different, you know, when you're the head versus like part of group. it's more important when you're part of a group to be a cohesive part and not like the leader. right, right, right, right. to be able to like understand directions and like, i mean if there's an issue like work it out. but to be able to take, you know, instructions and think about it and work with other people to encourage them to do the same. so, this is one time we kind of an issue. so, we were going to a meet and you have to travel a lot for golf. because golf courses are big and not very common. you can pass into something like a soccer field. so, we were going out into the inlands of california and our car broke down. and it was early in the morning. no one had no sleep. this is girls, teenage girls, no caffeine, not enough sugar, not enough breakfast. we were in a really old car and my coach was like 30 minutes ahead. and we were going to be late. we blew a tire actually. so, we called aaa but it was stressful. but we ended up playing games and like i led a yoga session on the highway. which was, you know, hilarious. and we're there in these ridiculous outfits. we're wearing like, as berkeley high we wore stupid outfits on purpose. we had like knee-high argyles and like hobos. it was so funny. i can only imagine how we looked. alright. can you tell me what are your weaknesses and what you're trying to do to overcome it? yeah, so i'm not super great with being organized. like, i'm alright. but especially with administrative things like paperwork and... i'm good with deadlines but only if i set reminders. so, even for example, trying to get into this building today was an adventure. or remembering to fill out all the forms for like my year off and everything is... could be a certain time sort of struggle. okay. and why do you think you should get into medical school? well, i love helping people and i'm going to be a great doctor. i have good dexterity. i like to study. i find medicine fascinating. i feel like i could really make the most impact. that way i would utilize my skills for the best way possible. great.",AGGR,4.78938728037,4.5240255566,4.77144902038,6.17102032091,5.28722854802,5.80582515268,6.38487933885,5.1046814048,5.03461389739,6.16352077699,5.53404859109,5.51372021512,3.76562654207,5.61660066264,5.80737630646,5.63548254177,6.16410359022,5.26987205399,97.3434618004
p72," sure. how are you doing today? good. how are you? good. tell me about yourself. so i'm rebecca. i'm a junior studying linguistics. and i think i'm interested in doing linguistic research after undergrad. great. tell me about the time you demonstrated leadership. let's see. so i did ra. i was an ra in my dorm and we were in charge of leading a group of freshmen in advising them for academic reasons and also in doing organizing events around the dorm. so i would occasionally be in the leadership position for that. great. and tell me about the time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? let's see. for a linguistics project, i had to do, we were working on a team or a group project. and there was a problem. one of the members wasn't contributing their work on time. and so we had to resolve that. so the members who had been working together got together and we decided to call that person in and just sort of discussed it with them and said that it was holding everyone back and we were able to resolve it. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? one of my weaknesses would probably be shyness or fear of talking from people i guess. so i've been doing more projects. a lot of times in linguistics we have to give presentations. so i've been doing more of that and i actually volunteered to teach a splash class this fall so that involved getting up in front of a lot of people and teaching something. and that was actually really fun so i feel like doing things, that was sort of a way where i enjoyed what i was teaching about so it seemed less intimidating. and i hope that doing things like that will get me over in my fear of talking to people. great. and why do you think we should hire you? i think i have pretty strong credentials. i'm doing well in all my classes and i really enjoy research and linguistics and i think i would work well with others and would be able to take on leadership roles if necessary. and i think i would just have a lot to offer.",AGGR,4.72726274526,4.55296200649,4.58784646141,5.19713280141,4.03536729622,5.12916464945,5.38647332074,4.69213699737,3.56543898623,4.7531530464,5.72766338027,4.46757143232,4.76919910459,4.66205485593,4.65622053478,5.80444517752,5.76829736038,3.95114812163,86.4335382784
p66," so how are you? i'm doing pretty good. how about you? i'm doing pretty well. well i wrote in brawl so it's not too early. i thought i was going to snow but i guess i'll take like a drizzle for that. so tell me about yourself. i'm a junior obviously here at mit. i'm studying chemical, biological engineering and minoring in economics. i live in kappa signal which is one of the fraternities on amherst, illinois, in conor. i'm from chicago. i was just home recently for thanksgiving. and then here on campus i obviously go to class. i'm not a huge fan of class. i do though like getting involved in my fraternity as well as i'm in charge of hepatite for humanity here so i do well with them. and some community service stuff that we have as well. cool. where are you going to? oh cool. where? i'm from skaquie. oh yeah, we were in skaquie. cool. so tell me about your time when you demonstrated leadership. so if i had to give, i guess an example of leadership recently this semester i'd probably talk about with hepatite for humanity like i mentioned before. i'm currently the president of the club and so we do a couple of different things on campus here both on and off campus related to the international organization. and so one of the big things we do on campus is we have what we call the beaver dash and it's a 5k run around the west end of campus. and we've done about five of them now. and so this year, since i was in charge of the club, i had to organize it. and it was kind of a unique situation because we were working with the president's office combining with president gryff's inauguration actually, they contacted me. oh wow. which was awesome because they have a ton of money and a lot of resources that i normally wouldn't have so i was able to work with them. but i think it was a really interesting leadership position because i was coordinating my own exact which is 10 students who i work with as well as the greater club which is a couple hundred people who kind of actively participate but then also in conjunction with the president's office which was a couple people and then a few people in staff with like the z center and daper and things like that. and so we were all kind of working together to organize this larger than normal event in conjunction with other activities going on that weekend. so it definitely took some going to meetings with like kind of staff and like more important people in the world of mit as well as my relaying messages and working with like my own board and getting stuff done and then boothing to sell like tickets and then the actual running of the event and coordinating of volunteers and things like that. so i think it was a really good leadership opportunity and really allowed me to interface with a lot of different people. excellent. so tell me about a time when you were working on a team. you faced a challenge. how did you go about solving? let's think of a good challenge. okay, so more recently i was working as, like i said, i'm involved with my fraternity and so in my fraternity i'm currently a vice president and one of, excuse me, my objectives was actually to plan like a little retreat that we have, we'd go camping and stuff like that. and so as part of that i work with a team of people, some of them are freshmen, which is kind of who the retreat was meant for, but some of them are other classmen as well. i mean everyone's my friend, but so it's like the interesting dynamic is you're working with your friends but you have to kind of be managing them and stuff like that. so that was i guess challenge number one, but then the real challenge was to coordinate essentially like we have 60 people and we wanted to go camping somewhere so i would get those 60 people there and then i think the real challenge we faced was getting people to commit and to like count accurate numbers and stuff like that and so i was able to like kind of within the context of the team utilize different people to like actually personally go and talk to like all 60 people so you get a feel for like who was actually coming because like an issue we had in the past was like 50 people would say for sure they're going to come and then on the day of 40 people would and then those 10 people are actually like hundreds of dollars you're wasting in so it was really important to get an accurate account, get people to realize the importance of commit and also to get like certain information on like who had like dietary restrictions, who needed, who were camping so like who had sleeping bags and who did and things like that. and like traditionally it is really nice to do like just like emails to get all that but here we're really utilizing talking to people and like having meetings together and then breaking out and talking to individuals and then like doing allocation of like who was going to call the various utilities whether it be car rental or food rental or food purchase and stuff like that so there's a lot of different allocation of tasks and then like individual talking of people and so those kind of overcame those different challenges we had to face. excellent. so, tell me about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to overcome. yeah, so i would say my greatest weakness currently the best way i guess to phrase it would be i feel like i need to be very involved in the things i do whether they be like a, i mean if i'm doing a piece edit it's me by myself so it kind of makes sense that i'm involved in doing a project or if i'm leading an activity or something. i feel like i need to kind of like be very on top of what's going on which is of course a good thing. you obviously if you're in charge of something or involved with something want to be aware of what's happening but i think my core weakness is that it leads me to not allocate enough to other people and also to then like consequently stress myself out and possibly not have as good of a final product because i've taken too much on for myself and so that's obviously a weakness and what i've kind of been currently doing to counter it is really working on finding like especially like friends of mine who i can provide this in and talk to about like asking them to like kind of overview some of the projects that i'm leading and also especially if they're involved in it like very specifically delegating stuff to them and working on kind of like not doing as much and not being invested in many things and trusting others to do stuff and get the job done and like setting very specific deadlines for when i will like let someone work without checking in and things like that to really promote like letting them go do their own thing and not concerning myself with it obviously responsibly but like at the same time to better allocate tasks and not overburden myself. that makes a lot of sense. so i'd like you to think about a job that you'd like to have. got it? sure. okay. so now what do you think we should, how are you for this job? so i think i bring a lot to the table as i accounted for this position. having been here for two and a half years at mit i've had the opportunity to do a lot of gain a lot of technical skills of course. i'm taking classes, i've done laboratory research, i've worked on various projects through those classes and so i think i have a lot of technical skills and i in this position at this company would really have the ability to take those and start applying them and combining them more importantly with the other skills i picked up here which have been leadership and communication skills. because there are other kind of have been in separate realms. i do a lot of activities on campus where i've had the opportunity to plan events or be a leader in various things and to be able to kind of take that and then put those skills towards like a technical related problem which i would be able to do with this company and really hone both of those together i would think would be very advantageous to me and very advantageous to you as the company and really allow me to kind of show off the different abilities i've learned here. well thank you for coming. yeah, of course.",AGGR,5.51747657291,5.82285472738,4.8995670953,6.19329952373,6.2141565891,5.73109802343,5.84351938386,5.48385652592,2.52017711215,5.60937461722,4.9450856006,5.02227797129,4.51540977032,5.47987536941,5.69672710925,5.31157899109,5.53901940689,5.56750067787,95.9128550677
p8," so how are you doing? i'm doing great, how are you? i'm well, thank you. so please tell me about yourself. so i'm an undergraduate in the third year here at mit and i'm studying computer science. i've been really interested in applying for software job. i want to gain more experience in web development and software development and also get some exposure into data science and machine learning. that plays out in the industry setting since i've done some research. tell me about how many demonstrate leadership. leadership. so currently i'm on the south asian american students exec board. so that's basically like the indian cultural club for undergrads. and i'm secretary and community service chair. so i'm currently organizing, reaching out to groups in the boston area and groups that work overseas in india for charity and community service opportunities that i can connect to undergrads here. and i'm also involved in other activities that sas, the group, is involved in setting up and planning study breaks, our recent garbo, which is the indian dance festival. and also i'm in the phi kappa data fraternity. and i've held leadership positions there in my freshman year in our pledge class when i was the community service chair for that as well. and led my class of 15 in going out into community. and we went down into different places in boston, helped clean up streets, et cetera. so please tell me at the time when you're working in a team and face a challenge, how did you solve the problem? so with this community service that my pledge class did for my fraternity, one glaring problem was getting everybody to respond, communicate well, and show up. class of 15 isn't too big. but when we're all mit students, we're all just getting settled, it's kind of hard to keep everybody on task. so what i did to solve this problem was once i set up, one thing i did was set up a group text that basically keep us on touch and would facilitate making sure that everybody was staying involved. it would be easier to keep track also of who was actually responding because people check text better than emails. and that's what we've been using for these. i also tried to unsuccessfully, but proposed like a point system basically to reward those who would show up and penalize those who didn't. so we have chores basically in our house to keep us in the clean houseworks and crews. and basically, if you accumulated a certain number of points or points for that, you would have to do extra crews or housework depending on when you didn't show up for an event during that process. tell me about one of your weaknesses and how do you plan to overcome it? i think probably my biggest weakness is staying focused on tasks. when i am working on tasks and i am focused, i'm able to work really efficiently and i come up with good ideas. but i frequently get distracted. however, i've been, well, my way to overcoming this through friends of working, studying with friends who've trained me to stay more on task, done things like finding better places to work and study with respect to schoolwork. and also sleep schedules are frequently a major problem for undergrads in terms of how that affects your study habits. and so i've been working on that to help stay fresher and more focused when i do my work. now, why do you think we should hire you? i think we should hire you because i have a lot of ideas. i'm really good at coming up with ideas during the table, especially in terms of software development. i've been in projects for school and in one or two my own independent projects. i've been working on them by myself and with friends. i've been good at optimization of software and coming up with good ideas on the user end. so i'm able to look at a project from different standpoints and think about what all parties would want, what would be easiest for the development team as well as the end users. thank you for coming. thank you.",AGGR,4.82408236307,4.74289539148,4.67844344661,5.6053236562,4.23397310045,5.42917193311,3.57292754361,4.45332435259,2.64427783107,4.99635315525,5.50466433262,4.15706890643,4.57497972608,5.66272840945,5.05170676861,5.8237382037,5.89634322184,5.10466133283,86.956663675
p67," so how are you today? i'm actually doing pretty well. i just, i would say, well it's the end of the semester almost, right after thanksgiving break. so i had a bunch of time to relax, that sort of thing. this is the first time i didn't go home though. so i spent a bunch of time actually with my friends in my fraternity and we baked thanksgiving dinner together. turkey, the whole shebang. most people around this time have all sorts of exams, that sort of thing. but all things considered compared to like freshman, sophomore, junior year, i'm actually taking an extra semester, so i'm technically a junior, that sort of thing. it's pretty relaxed. things are good. so please tell me about yourself. well, to start, i guess the three things that i'm doing right now, i'm president of my fraternity, sae, which i also helped start up. it's one of those new fraternities that just like, you know, came out of nowhere. well, we were back on campus a while ago, that's history. i'm a lightweight rower and i'm also a chemical engineer. you know, most people have to say course 10 major, that sort of thing. and i'm part of the gordon engineering leadership program. so all things considered, i would say the things that i've learned the most since i've come to mit are working with people, leadership skills, being confident, being able to go in front of people and sort of create a vision and help people follow that vision. i've had issues in the past of time management. i've spent a long time doing freshman, sophomore year learning the importance of sleep, a bunch of things like that. so i've gone through the whole, all the trials and tribulations. but all things considered, i'd say right now, i'm pretty much, you know, like, i've hit a groove. i'm doing the things that i want to do. and i'm having a good time. so, back to leadership. time to time when you act as a leader? well, just like this whole semester. like, since i've been the president of my fraternity, i've had to deal with situations where there's people, they're called brothers. yes. where they, for some reason, they have these issues and for some reason they can't talk them out. so i'm the kind of person that i know i can tell when someone's having a bad day. and then i sort of like pry, not pry, but like press a little bit until they either like decide they don't want to tell me anymore or until they, you know, tell me what's going on. and i guess there's one case, kind of a sensitive matter, but there was a person that became a pledge of our fraternity. but that was from like the previous president and that whole, it's called rush. yes, i might see a long, so. okay, got you, got you, got you. and basically what happened is this guy came in and very few people knew when they came in. and once they actually got to know more for the summer, they didn't like him at all. so i had to deal with the situation of trying to find out what we do. like, do we let him stay? do we let him go through the program and see if he improves? or do you sort of like nip it at the bud right there? and i brought it, like first off, i didn't even want to bring that question up in front of a bunch of people until i got the information. so i talked to people individually, got a feel for it, and then i sort of predicted how the conversation was going to go. ultimately what ended up happening is we nipped it at the bud. and we had to do it like a very nice way of letting the guy know. but it's all kind of, you know, touchy-feely sensitive stuff. and i really had to make sure i talked to everyone before that happened. that's an excellent example for leadership. so this is a similar question but related. tell me at the time when you worked on a team, you faced a challenge. not this one, but a different one. how did you go about solving it? of course, time. ice, integrated chemical engineering is a class where you have, like, you're given a team and most people, well, you can actually choose your team. and most people throughout their tenure find people that they're good at working in p-sets with, that sort of thing. but by the time that i wanted to choose my team, most of my friends had been swooped up. so i was with kind of a random group of people, which actually turned out pretty well. the project itself is we have to design a chemical engineering plant. so you have to do the reactors, you have to do the heat flow, the mass flow, control all the distillation columns, etc., etc. and then there's a big report, there's all sorts of stuff. and general breakdown was, you know, there's one person that sort of becomes the expert in working like the program, the aspen program. and then there's another person that's more like working on the actual write-up. and then there's another person that sort of integrates the two. so what was the question? i'm working in a team. if it's a challenge, how do you solve it? okay. i guess the biggest issue that came up in that project is, you know, approaching the deadline two or three days before the actual, the final project was due. the main issue that came up is a lot of the code wasn't working, a lot of the projects weren't working. so it's a pretty typical mit scenario. yes. and the main thing that was the issue is that the guy that was responsible for doing the coding was a really silent guy in the group. so he's like the silent coder that was just off doing his own work. so when we were trying to integrate the rest of the project, my other teammate and i had been collaborating a lot with this other team. but this other guy sort of been off in his own world. so when he delivered his part of the project, you know, it was difficult to integrate. so what we had to do is we had to sit down, all three of us together, and go play by play with this guy to find out what his reasonings were and sort of try and reach a medium with a day left to get the project together. and i'd say the hardest part about that was simply interacting with this man because he was just very quiet. he did get a lot of quality work done. but like looking back, what i would have tried to do better is like notice that he was a quieter person and really try and get him to be a little bit more evocative and like, you know, sharing the thoughts and stuff that he's doing during like beginning to end. the project, like we ended up having the deliverable on time and the spec, but it would have been better if we had started with the issue from the beginning. it wasn't both in design and cases. yeah. that makes a lot of sense. so, what about one of your greatest weaknesses and what you've done to overcome it? at the end of every single group that i'm with, you know, everyone always has like the critique phase where they get to say what you did well and what you did do as well. i can come off as being a little bit, well, gregarious is one thing, but also sometimes like i get dominated conversation. so that's one thing i learned from the gordon engineering leadership program. and it's the thing where you identify each of your skills and find out the ones you're good at, ones you're bad at. and the thing that i'm really trying to work on is not dominating a conversation. so i've been working on it over the years and the main ways i try and try to do that is first off, don't be the guy that always takes the leadership role right from the get go. what i do is instead if there's, you know, a little bit of like if someone's having a hard time or there's no leader that's emerging, i'll start giving suggestions. and then people can start jumping onto those suggestions and if i notice there's a person that's really good, like really engaged or really wants to take this forward, i'll find a way to make it so they become the leader and instead of me directing everyone and sort of imposing, i really ask for everyone's input and make it so everyone feels involved in the group. so this has been more of not like a one example and i changed after that it's been a gradual process because in the beginning i just sort of like loudmouth asking tons of questions saying, ah yeah let's all do this, that sort of thing and kind of falling in love with my own ideas. and i really try and get other people's input instead. nice lot of sense. so think about a job that you'd like to have. got one in mind? yeah, i've been thinking about it for a while. so tell me why do you think you should have this job? i think it's about consulting. a lot of people think about consulting. the main reason why it's intriguing me right now is because it's the kind of job where you have one very fast pace, but two, the critical factor is teamwork and working with other people that are, you know, of like a variety of ages, being able to extract information and essentially have a project that's got, you know, a very short, i don't know, really totally short timeline, but it's got a timeline, it's got a scope, and it's got a budget. and being able to find different resources, make those connections, start building relationships with new people, which is i think one of the most important things, building relationships is critical. and then being able to sort of continue to tap those same resources and continue to expand as i get new projects, while also being able to find out or getting a breadth of, you know, a variety of different fields. i thought about like energy and semiconductors. i sort of decided not to do semiconductors because of the class i'm taking right now, at least for now. but i think the main thing is just that the teamwork is the critical part in getting new connections. best of your personality. can imagine you wanting to do that. that makes a lot of sense. thank you. well, this concludes the formal part of the interview.",AGGR,5.83677449761,5.24203005412,4.26818252056,6.1728960422,5.7368392955,6.59741070031,6.29946084889,4.92479784023,4.20432537602,5.46545664091,4.83959782896,6.11673825755,4.43546976733,5.75620281651,6.13901746037,5.93363465083,5.80140651932,6.24781567325,100.01805679
p73," how are you doing today? i'm good, how are you? good. tell me about yourself. i'm amanda, i'm a freshman at mit. so, i'm currently looking into courses 6 and 18. so, computer science and math. and i play cello in the orchestra. and i'm a part of sigma gap. good. so, tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. yeah, one time in high school i was the president of our youth board for united way, which is a nonprofit that raises money and awareness for social and economic problems. and then we built and tried to change them. and so, my senior year as part of the youth board, we ended up fundraising and starting a new fundraiser. and it was a hockey game between our hockey team and the private school's hockey team, which wasn't really a fair game, but it was okay. and it was very down to the wire, which we weren't aware of. i mean, planning an event around winter break is never really easy, schedule-wise and stuff, but it was definitely a challenge for us. and it ended up being successful and we raised over $4,000 for us, yeah. the organization is definitely one of my favorite. it lets students have a way to get back to their community, which was a big deal for us since actually that year we lost three kids to suicide's via train in a few months. and so, it was really nice for us to have a way to actually get back to our community instead of just thinking about it and wishing we could do something. so, it worked out really nicely for us to really make a difference. so, tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? i mean, in school we get a lot of projects that are group projects. and i've noticed that i tend to be a person who, when the slack starts to happen, i just kind of do it and after a while it gets very taxing to pick up for everyone. and so, i remember senior year we just had this project in math and it was just so frustrating to do it by myself. and so, i just sat everyone down and i was like, i can't do this on my own anymore. and i really need your help. it was really nice because they were my friends and they didn't realize they were doing it. and so, we made up a new plan and redivvied the work and it worked out in the end. good. and can you tell me a weakness, one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? yeah, i'm kind of a perfectionist and i like everything to work out well which means that when i'm sorting something new sometimes i can't look over the little details that i don't see that will work and i don't get how you can just look past that to see a bigger picture and come up with a big idea and then work on the small details later and kind of more detail oriented and then work for the bigger goals. so, that's definitely been one of my problems that i've been working on getting over that. but just thinking about it in the future and just, you know, you can get there and you look at the bigger goal and then if you divvied up into smaller tasks it's a lot easier to overcome and deal with everything. good. baby steps. what do you think we should hire you? i think you should hire me because i've had a lot of experience dealing with other people and communicating and making sure that coming up, like to come up with the best solution that everyone can hopefully agree with and, you know, of course not everyone can get their way but it's important to try to get everyone's ideas into one if you can.",AGGR,5.60926577555,5.04311324985,5.0372789287,5.41645375705,5.02620075772,5.17074693087,5.35919667782,5.08078880667,5.8199866881,5.87249827675,5.32596353287,5.20198092437,5.50660377243,6.09189739556,6.34390405177,5.80650741863,6.37956541094,5.44625330175,99.5382056574
p65," so how are you doing today? yeah, pretty good. don't be particularly different from any other day. so, please tell me about yourself. so, i'm from near belfast in northern ireland. i have three younger brothers. so, i think they have kind of influenced me probably as much as i have influenced them, like mark, the next one done. he's only a year younger than me, so he was always a lot sportier. coming up through school, he was playing rugby and cricket and everything because of that, i got into those sports. and then ian, the next one, died after him. he's a lot more artsy and stuff. so, i think because of his influence, i'm kind of a bit more appreciative of things that i would have maybe just kind of disregarded before. like when i was down in new york, we went to mooma and there was like the scream by montchamon chou, which was there, and some van gogh, starry night, and some lilies by moona. so, i wouldn't really be too fussed about that. but i was like, you know what, ian will probably want to hear about this. so, i'll go and i'll take some photos for him. and then harry's the youngest one. he's kind of like, he just gets away without everything being the youngest. but, she would be pretty good to get back home on christmas and i can catch up with alan's stuff. probably not get back over to cambridge in the uk with christmas rick, but i've been trying to keep in contact with friends from there. it's really like this, working stuff. and yeah, just really enjoying my time here at the minute. it's a little bit of a background on me and my family. excellent. so, tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership. so, this, i'm here on my third year, what you would call junior year. so, my first two years at cambridge, i was part of the student council for the college that i'm in there, romans and college. so, as part of that we do a bake. we call it freshers' wake, or as you used to kind of call it freshman, rush, dorm exploration, whatever. so, we had a big kind of end of that week finale event that took over college, like multiple music stages, the legal drink in age in the uk as you attain whoever in a university could drink. so, there's different promotions on different bars about the place in the college, different attractions and stuff. so, just kind of plan and not deciding what the theme would be, how we were going to decorate up the college to tie in with that. media isn't getting music acts, getting promotions on in the mean bar. just making sure we were covered health and safety wise in terms of enough kind of stewards, fire extinguisher points, emergency plans. obviously, working as part of a committee on that, but then being responsible for individual sections, particularly on the night being responsible for a particular area. i think that's quite a practical hands-on time, would have been given leadership. i think i've done quite well with it. excellent. sounds like a fun time. hey, what was, yeah. so, telling you about the time you were working on a team and you faced a challenge, how did you do about solving? right, so, again, taking back cambridge in the uk, one of the things that cambridge is known quite well for is ruin. so, i got to cambridge and i was like, oh, i've never tried ruin before, i'll take this off. so, in my first year there was me and a few of my friends took it out. and we continued it in our second year. one of our friends then decided that he didn't have time for it and he was going to kind of drop it by the wayside. but we had the big kind of races there towards the end of the summer term, they're called the may bumps. and obviously, any kind of sport teamwork is important, but in ruin, like so much of it is just getting in time with each other and working as one and it takes like the whole year to build up this. so, him deciding to pull out that late was really going to be massively detrimental because you can get someone to sub in and fill the seat, but it's not the same. so, convincing him to stay on as part of the team and kind of rallying it, like getting a good boot spirit that we weren't just yet guys who kind of rode, but we all got along well and we actually wanted to rule for each other and because i've been given responsibility as boat captain, so not like the overall boat club captain but captain of that boat. so, doing things like having pre-race males together, watching like video clips beforehand, like kind of motivational rocky style stuff and just making sure that like we were training hard but people were enjoying training and it was the right kind of balance between yeah, we need to train at this level to be good but we don't need to go absolutely overboard and we can gauge when people just need time off or need time to unwind or de-stress. so, kind of implementing that and then it came around to the actual bumps races. he hadn't quit and we managed to do a lot better than we had the previous term. the previous term had been a bit of a disaster and then this term we were actually the best boat from the college so that was pretty satisfying. and again, it just kind of shows like the races are painful and tough but you work together, you get through them, you feel good after. so that was like a pretty obvious sport, an example of team one. so, tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome them. i think overall i'm quite like confident and happy to talk to people and stuff but maybe a weakness could be that i do sometimes dive into things a little too eagerly. it could almost be that i could become better at these kind of interviews by just having the not extra-read conference to just sit there quietly for 20, 30 seconds think what the question actually specifically asked and then answer it rather than thinking, okay they've stopped talking, i better start and just dive in and then answer. i'm coming across then as perhaps a bit frantic or not completely focused. so i think something like that is just going to be practice, like do interviews, get comfortable with sitting with a little bit of silence while i compose my thoughts and then go into a well-structured answer rather than just dive in straight into an answer as i've kind of been doing i think so far. i actually thought i was surprisingly good job. so now think of a job that you'd like to have. so why do you think we should hurry? i think that obviously to hire someone they need to have the qualifications that are going to allow them to do well in the job but like almost any job in today's world isn't going to be specifically tied down to one individual's sector. it's going to require skills across a variety of disciplines and i think that i've used my university time so far in the uk and in america really broadening the experience that i've got, broadening my exposure to different fields of engineering and also using the really quite amazing house programming out here to broaden my exposure to even artsy stuff. and i also think that through projects and lab work and things of that nature i have the skills to work in a team, be that having the kind of humility to accept that okay there's someone more experienced, more knowledgeable than me than this. i'll take the lead from them or also realize when it's an appropriate time that okay i'll take the lead here because no one else is really going to or i'm the best qualified to really take command. so i think like in terms of working with others as a strength i have and i think in terms of contributing to like the overall atmosphere in the company i'm quite a pleasant, optimistic person. i like to think that i'm someone that others would be happy to work around so not only would i be working well but others would be working well through my being there. i'm not saying that i'm going to suddenly make the company like 200% more profitable but i do think that i'll feedback in as much benefit as i'll get out of a job that i would genuinely enjoy. well thanks for coming today. okay, thank you.",AGGR,5.22422953574,5.23406839622,5.30833863712,5.83802269775,4.53060123974,6.03696554353,4.4677826891,4.30303347658,4.03039648042,5.35568340533,5.31094011898,4.99971598947,4.63501493131,6.25781388858,6.16928747395,5.61512899062,6.6323997375,5.17731050305,95.126733735
p71," how are you doing today? good. tell me about yourself. i'm an mit undergraduate junior studying mechanical engineering. and i'm doing the flexible course which allows me to concentrate in an area other than mechanical engineering. so i chose building technology. and i'm hoping to get a double minor in energy and architecture as well. busy. sorry? you're busy. yes. tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. i've taken on several leadership roles in my story. one of the most recent roles was a cpw chair. so our university holds a weekend to invite prospective students who have been accepted but have not decided to come to mit yet. and it's an important time to show them how great mit is but also to give them a taste of different activities on campus. so i organized a dinner at our house with a co-chair. and then this year i'm planning all of our social events. so they're basically three large formal events. tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? so in high school i was really involved on the robotics team. i had three other teammates. and it was very difficult to narrow down ideas. everyone had different views, different opinions about how we should do things. and i think that communication was the most important thing. making sure that we were putting our ideas on the table but also listening to each other. that was one of the most important factors in our success. we ended up doing pretty well. that was a great practice. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to the comment? one of my weaknesses is going out of my comfort zone as far as what i'm studying. so i think that in high school because i was so involved in robotics, i didn't really look outside of mechanical engineering. and then my parents are also architects which is where that came from. so there are two things that i'm really passionate about. especially being at mit, there are so many other areas i am kind of neglecting. particularly the arts and stuff. and i feel it's important to have a balance and not really achieving that right now. why do you think we should hire you? i believe that i have a very strong educational background in the field. i'm really passionate about the subject. it's something that i've been exposed to in the past because my parents are architects. but at the same time, it's something that i think is very important for the future. in terms of energy consumption. i knew i wanted to go into some sort of energy field at mit. and i think i found out that i really enjoy it. good!",AGGR,4.8643857389,4.9386559798,5.14575836792,4.66468493244,4.51357622051,4.58503726946,5.87601448384,4.98071639371,4.12803108401,5.89894079967,5.24214913249,4.33945671514,4.72711816786,5.03445911625,5.23388946728,5.55900758443,5.99441909792,4.64344665356,90.3697472052

p64," okay, mike. please tell me about yourself. so, i'm, i'm from russia. i've grown up in finland though and i normally go to cambridge university, which is where i study. here i am for an exchange program with my team. i study course six. mainly, i focus my interests, split them more like, between electrical engineering where i focus more on device physics, like nano-electronics, processing methods, circuits, and also stuff that has to do with things like ai, control, machine learning, which is what i'm quite interested in. i've been taking courses to that goal. so, things like 6034, 6152, 6719. in those same areas, i've done several projects. like, so in cambridge over summer, i did a, i wrote a simulator. the simulator basically simulates a landing on mars and has to take into account realistic physics, graphics, planetary rotation. and i have to write an ai which accounts for all that and is able to land and launch an spacecraft. similarly, i've also been participating in a robot competition in cambridge. it was similar to mit's mass lab and i was on the software team again, although i helped out of electronics. and the goal of that project was to, in 18 of six, create a robot which is able to navigate a black, a white grid on a black table and be able to pick up a cylinder thing with a magnet or without a magnet and based on whether it is magnetic or not, take it to a certain box. and i have programmed the ai for that. so, that's most expensive had. in cambridge here, i've been considering participating in things like battle code or mass lab perhaps. there's been some quite interesting projects going on in class. that's also been quite interesting. oh, excellent. mass lab is a wonderful experience. yeah, yeah, here's pretty good. so, tell me about time when you demonstrate leadership. so, again, in the robotics project competition at cambridge, in our team of six, i had to in some ways help out and direct the design choices for the competition. some things include deciding which sensors to be placed in where and kind of the overworking idea was that basically because i'm writing the ai, i have to have a clear idea of what the robot has to do, what its capabilities are. and i was the one to be the go-to guy in case somebody had to make a decision based on that. and i made decisions just based on rationality where if something was... the idea is that somebody has to be only as complicated as it needs to be and no more complicated because any other complications make problems, stuff doesn't work, breaks. so, yeah. and i also helped out with the electronics and sometimes they were sure which sensors to hook up to which control lines and stuff like that. and i had to advise them on what i wanted to be done for the ai to work properly. another case of leadership, i guess, would be so. i did military service in finland as a citizen. and so we had this at the end of the service, near to the end. there was an anti-air camp where all the anti-air regiments and italians of finland come together in this one big training camp. and as a member of the communication squad, we had to go and set up some things for the live fire exercises. and because our sergeant was away doing some things, i don't know what he was doing. but i had to take charge of the squad and make sure that the cables were done right and had to delegate tasks to certain people. these two guys do this cable and these guys set up the radios and i'll do this. so, yeah. it was quite alright, i guess that way. that's all that was a lot of sense. i guess we can go to some more of the details. can you tell us just how many worked on a team and faced a challenge? how did you solve the problem? well, with six people, we split each ourselves into three teams, these sub-teams. one was mechanical, one was electrical, and one was ai. because my programming experience was much bigger than the programming experience of the other guy on my team, we said that it would be better if he was to help out with the mechanics because there's a lot of hand work to be done, a lot of design work there. and the ai is easily written by me when i just kind of have a clear idea of it's much faster than splitting it with other people. it was rather simply ai, i guess. now, with the mechanics, it's much more important that they get all this stuff done, these two-centimeter workshop work. so, that was a decision we had to make to kind of get more of that kind of hand work to the mechanical team and more of the mechanical team. with the electrical team, we decided that there would be one guy doing most of the design work for the electronics because he had a better idea. and the other guy would be doing most of the soldering of the electronic parts because we got some basic components. we got this controller block with a cpu inside, but it had to be wired to sensors and controllers and motor controllers and all that, and we had to do all of those circuits. so, one of the guys, oscar, was much more into that. so, he took charge into design and calvin, much more of the soldering and stuff. and that kind of helped out when they needed some help. so, yes, we decided to have a clear delegation of tasks and just did a bit and tried to make sure that when somebody needed something done, we'd be able to produce a kind of working-ish result so they'd be able to test stuff out. so, for example, i made a control system which follows the lines way before i wrote any of the code for picking up stuff and testing what it is and how to choose where it goes. the idea was that i am able to follow the line and turn. which is kind of tricky, actually, because of the way the sensors are set up and because the motors weren't actually properly balanced and such. so, the mechanical guys managed to rig together a quick rig with just some of the basic plates that didn't cut them or anything. so, he's got a plate, put some motors on, hooked up the motors directed to the cpu and did that. and it worked. i was able to make the ai which follows the lines, which was pretty good. also, that did mean that oscar, who made the sensor connectors, he had to kind of work faster and make those particular circuits before he made any of the other control circuits. but by delegating those things that way, we were able to do step by step and do gradually. excellent. so, tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you're going about to work about improving. i guess one of my weaknesses is that i often get carried away, i guess somewhat arrogantly, when i'm working on something and i may think that i have a really good idea of what i'm doing. somebody's better than other people, i have a better idea of wondering than other people and therefore try to tell them that maybe they're doing it slightly wrong or be somewhat more self-absorbing what resources need to be allocated because i feel like i'm doing a lot of stuff and that they might be doing it more slowly so i can use this for longer or something. not to the point of insulting people, but more kind of a center of attention kind of thing, i guess. i'm trying to kind of be more mindful of what other people are doing and sometimes that, even though i think i have an idea of what i'm doing, i don't actually or that i might be mistaken. so i try to be more kind of chill and laid back and just... yeah. but it's a working promise. definitely. so now finally, think of a job you'd like to have. so now why do you think we should hurry? well, you should hurry because i'm capable of pretty good verbal communication. i don't really stress out much, i think. so i'm quite relaxed that way. i'm able to speak three languages so i'm able to communicate quite well. or i should finish in english. and i tend to be quite good at being able to delegate tasks to people so i'd be good for a project lead, i guess. because i have pretty good technical backgrounds. i understand the tech and i quite enjoy working with the tech. but i also like being in a team environment where we can get tasks and work on different things. on something which we can accomplish by ourselves on a larger project. working in a team is quite fun if it works out right. definitely.",AGGR,4.73896974042,4.87605151658,4.17978510132,5.37798904819,4.3888214582,5.09887759951,2.89139255374,4.82550165163,4.45544507465,4.31347713723,3.47721024205,4.141321624,3.69357836245,5.9596641469,5.43258156813,5.53425605295,5.61711001912,4.96296453571,83.9649974328
p48," how are you? i'm doing well. excellent. so, please tell me about yourself. i'm a student. i studied computer science. i'm in my last year, so when i graduate in may i'm going to be working on computer science stuff. i'm going to ask you a series of questions. start with, tell me at a time, what do you demonstrate leadership? i demonstrate leadership on the track team. i was senior co-alter in the team. so, right now we're doing the conditioning and stuff like that and all throughout the preseason a lot of professional come and it's important to get them on the speed. so, the seniors in the team, myself included, lead them throughout the workouts and stuff like that and it's important to be able to stand up and let them know how the tradition is and stuff like that. tell me at a time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge, how did you go about solving the problem? in my living group, we had a problem that the rent was getting too expensive because we didn't have quite enough people living there, but we still had a set amount of rent that we had to pay as a group. so, the prices were going up to the point that people had to get kicked out. so, that was pretty rough, but this happened like a year ago. so, one of my close friends was like, i can't afford these prices, there's just no way. and then it dominoes, which was a huge problem. and a lot of people suggested a lot of different solutions, most of them were motivated from anger. so, some people were like, oh yeah, everybody who moves out just doesn't have to pay and other people were like, oh no, if i'm not living there, i shouldn't have to do anything. so, it was pretty contentious. but we worked it out to, it was like a variation of a plan that i suggested, which was that we would change the rent based on room size and how many people live in the room. so, we'd allow people to have more space themselves and pay more. but people who would have otherwise been forced out could have more people acclaimed into a room and save a lot of money. so, we kept some of the people that we'd kicked out. oh, good. yeah, but it was pretty rough to get that motion passed. so, you're talking about one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to improve on it? the opposite of ty day. so, i can be pretty disorganized. my lab notebooks, i've got a lot of scribbles in it and when i write code, the documentation tends to be on the shaky side. so, it makes it kind of hard for other people to follow when doing later on. and there really, that was a problem until the most recent project i've been on that i had to leave the project for a short amount of time. and then my partner picked up where i left off and he had no idea what was going on. and i was like, this is actually a problem. the teacher was like, don't just tell you to document. just aggregate you. so, i worked... so, since then, i've been working on documenting what i do just more diligently, but then also to check back up on it so that there's some kind of review before i show other people what i... or before i let it out to a point that other people might rely on it. so, just to read my documentation again, which i've never done before, until this most recent project had that problem. that's always a good practice. so, now, thinking about a job that you'd like to have, do you have one in mind? sure. okay. so, now, why should we hurry? mostly because results... i just get things done. and there's a lot of things i know how to do, especially the job i'm thinking of is programming job at a startup. and my background... my degree is actually nuclear engineering. so, i don't have the background, i don't have the internship and stuff like that. a lot of the coding interview questions i've asked, i tend to not know, which is pretty rough, but i think that i would be hired, i should be hired because i would be resourceful. and i do what it takes to get things done, which is like working longer, being more resourceful and stuff like that. so, i believe i can get more results than somebody who has the same background, or has a better background. excellent. well, thanks for coming today.",AGGR,4.43873711683,4.16714224842,4.5748072329,4.62694407073,3.79090431508,6.5625262454,4.53570791133,4.78221634128,4.62057092557,4.60665832203,5.57453554593,4.04476149582,4.14381035699,5.64429603021,4.87983071597,4.87191879348,5.23524044455,4.56366314079,85.6642712533
p60," yeah, how are you today? good, how are you? good. tell me about yourself. so, i'm from chicago and i'm a junior here at mit. when i came here i was pretty sure i wanted to do health related work so i guess i came in as a biology major. my dad's also an mdfhd, really interested, or really involved in research. and so, sort of, that influenced me a lot. so then i realized after doing biology for two years essentially that i wasn't really enjoying it. and so, i decided to try out computer science because it is mit after all. and i think if i did want to do biology in the future, which it's not that i don't like biology, it's that i didn't feel like i was learning skills that would contribute to the field in this. and so, yeah. and so i decided to do computer science. i mean, that's a very small part of me, but a very broad question. yeah. so, how about a time you demonstrated leadership? so, i am the co-president of an organization at mit called glomet. and what we do is we're partnered with a nonprofit grassroots organization abroad. so, our group, basically the nonprofit we work with does hiv healthcare work in togo. and so, yes, an example of leadership would be this whole semester, i suppose. it's been a work in progress. it's the first time i've ever been in a president's role in a group of about 30 people. and all the members are new this year. it's a new organization. so, it's sort of like realizing there's so many aspects of leadership. it's not just like not only the objectives that your group needs to get done, but also the camaraderie you have on a group and making sure that's being maintained properly. and we had a lot of really troublesome leadership experiences last year with this group. so, i guess i've been learning a lot. do you have specific questions about that? okay. what do you think about your experience? okay. yeah, so in terms of leading a group of people that are my age, and we're all new at it, it's definitely a work in progress. but we do a number of things in terms of we fundraise for, so we hold campaigns and we fundraise in order to basically fund our projects abroad in togo. so, our main project right now is to improve the technological efficiencies of the clinic that we were partnered with in togo. and so, it's hard sometimes motivating group of people when your partner is abroad. it's not like, we haven't met them yet because it's a new partnership. so, we're traveling there this summer, but since it's new, it's kind of, i think as a leader it takes a lot of like, not only vision and forward planning, but also like you have to be able to step back and allow other leaders in your group to step up. you can't just do everything yourself. even if that seems easier. and then also maintaining like the motivation among a group of people that are like really busy with other things in their lives. so, that's the biggest challenge i think. great. tell me about the time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? so, i guess the same organization, we've had a lot of problems. so, we are a team as an organization. so, last year i was like a director on the exec board, but not one of the co-presidents. and the biggest challenge we've had as a team was that our co-presidents were not motivated, had very poor communication, and we just didn't really get anything done. so, a challenge on my part was not really, i wasn't sure, i knew what needed to get done and i knew things needed to, like we needed to be more efficient and take initiative and motivate our staff because it's not just about us, we have people that depend on us. and the problem was not stepping on their toes at the same time while trying to get them motivated. but i think a challenge was that they felt personally attacked when people criticized them or when people tried to make suggestions for better things to do. so, i guess solving that problem is more just stepping back and being like, you can't do everything. if that person is the president, you just have to let them do what they're going to do and wait till your ends. do your job right, but don't try to push, like you can't always push through things. sometimes you just gotta let go and i guess that did kind of solve the problem. it didn't solve the problem of things not getting done, but i think realizing that actually helped a lot because it was just like banging your head against the wall. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? i guess the weakness of mine would be that i am pretty, knowing how to step back and not, basically not trying to do everything myself when it's definitely supposed to be a team effort. and that involves a lot of trust in other people and their competency. so, definitely giving people the chance to do the job right and sometimes giving second chances. so, i think that i might have a bad temper sometimes. that could be part of it. and what do you think we should hire you? i think because i'm very motivated and i have a lot of self-initiative and i'm hard on myself. so that sometimes i expect highly of other people in the same way and that could, i mean that is part of both the challenge and the weakness question that you've asked about. but i think that is good when you have a team of people and like you need somebody that is very like very ridiculous about delegating things properly and making sure things are done at the right time and somebody who like really takes self-responsibility for things. so, i think if it's a forward project for example, like a software project, it's good to have someone that isn't shy to speak up in a group and somebody that can sort of like organize the group to coordinate the group better, like vocally. thank you.",AGGR,4.86537928843,4.83159600236,5.16977580619,5.72848811602,5.41999012406,3.32818803648,5.82552343809,4.61096804761,3.55474600935,6.09971465882,5.2270828098,5.40983542452,4.07119407478,4.48492672176,4.90227995809,5.47951831287,5.99648379291,4.41876249439,89.4244531165
p74," tell me about yourself. um, okay, i am a computer science major. i'm a senior at mit, and i'm hoping to stay in the area next year. i'm looking for a job here. and i grew up in south dakota, and a little bit in cambodia. grew up on a farm. i really enjoy playing music and cooking. probably my two biggest hobbies. okay. tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. well, when i was in high school, i was the leader of my 4-h club. and that involved leading meetings. there were a lot of younger kids who were involved, and i helped them get involved in sewing competitions, for example, and things where they could learn about nutrition, and showing their animals, and learning about how to raise an animal well. so that was a big leadership role, and it was kind of difficult, but i definitely learned a lot from it. that's great. and tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? well, um, i played music with some of my friends, and some social settings. we played for a couple of weddings, and it's sometimes difficult to coordinate what we would like to play, and how we'd like to practice, and the styles of music that we'd like to play. and to do that properly, you just need to communicate a lot, and you need to be willing to sometimes do the things that you really don't want to do. okay. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? one of my weaknesses is probably procrastination. there's a ton of people, i'm sure. to overcome that, i am trying to structure my time, and plan out a schedule so that i will do one thing for an hour, and one thing for the next hour, so if i procrastinate for the whole hour, then i feel bad. so the idea is to avoid that. okay. and why do you think we should hire you? i think that i am a strong, strong learner, definitely. and whatever new skills, since in web development, there's always new technologies coming along. i am quick at learning those, and i really enjoy learning new things. and i have a good base with my computer science degree from mit. so i know in general how to think about programming.",AGGR,5.11090393639,4.91981245352,5.05539423735,5.27372703195,4.5719662824,5.67418548821,5.81608992543,4.97720019597,5.12217032282,5.39940836233,5.79684105134,4.20457727668,4.64128690398,5.64994390774,5.51744948413,5.60975410779,5.93366980377,4.94780195384,94.2221827256

p49," so, do you study about yourself? so, my name is fernando rivera. i am a junior here. i come from puerto rico and i am currently studying biological engineering. i'm considering doing pre-medicine maybe going into either an md, let's say i apply to some schools in md, or going to an md-phd program. my main interest is basically oncology. but over the past few years i've been doing research programs, urops, i did an internship, and it basically gave me a view that i could tackle that problem in a lot of ways. so, not just being a clinician, but being a medical researcher. and that's how i got interested in the whole md-phd thing. and i got a hold of some programs that i viewed and there's a lot out there. i could have imagined that if i still. it's amazing what people view. most definitely. so, can you tell me what a time when you demonstrated leadership? so, i'm pretty involved in campus groups. i was the first founder of their restructuring of beta thaifi. so i'm currently a usa chapter president. so i'm leading the whole calorie of recruitment right here in campus and we're getting a lot of results. i'm also in the board of puerto rican students. i function as social share. i am also pretty involved in dorm government, especially rec-cbw planning. so i just like to get around. so anything that gives me that type of opportunity to just explore and meet guys and celebrate google for me. i was also considering something for a soccer in terms of being a team treasurer. unfortunately, i had a bit of an accident with my legs. so i got out of the soccer. so can you tell me what a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge, how did you solve the problem? so i actually had a really, really humbling experience. last semester i took a class about mechanics. a lot of people in that class were juniors and i was a sophomore. so everybody there was much more experienced than me. so i was the only sophomore in my group. there were two ones that were juniors and it was the final project. and when we sat down and started talking about things to do, i basically had almost no knowledge of the things they were planning because they already took cell biology and they took really advanced courses in fluid dynamics and they were trying to do some tissue modeling. even though the class was about mechanics and i could understand some of the things, i had absolutely no idea what i was doing. and they just put me there and one of them was really helpful and actually guided me through the initial process but the other one was not available at all, anytime. so i basically had to sit down. i actually met with a professor a couple of times just to talk and chat and we took the professor out for lunch so we can just talk about stuff. and i actually had to find out my own way through everything with a little help of the only junior friend that was actually available to me. and it was humbling because normally when i worked on teams, we were all pretty equal, equal minded or it was in a humanities class. because normally technical classes here don't have that much team projects in sophomore year. normally laboratories and final design project classes are for older students. so it was a surprise for me when it came to emma sophomore, i'm already doing final presentations for biomechanics and it just caught me pretty off guard. and the only way, we ended up doing an extremely awesome project but it took lots of coffee, red bull and wikipedia. that's my strategy for now because it was completely new territory right there compared to humanities or any other classes where everybody has the same mindset. so that was my group trauma. so tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you've done to overcome. so i've been having actually trouble, self recognizable trouble about, so stepping off from the inexperience type of situation, that was actually the first group project i had where the experience happened. and i feel like if i get into something that i don't basically know, i have a really hard time finding stuff out for myself. so if i don't come prepared to do something, it takes me a while to get to a pace to actually start absorbing material and actually contributing, which is kind of a handicap because some students are already up to speed and they already expect something from me. and obviously i would like to give out my all and hand them everything they want in a little platter but it's hard for me. so basically the solution for me was basically putting much more effort from my part but it's still a big minus in my turf. it takes me a while to dominate things that i don't have an up to speed education to. and that has cost like mishaps that well through hard work you can overcome them but a lot of work compared to your regular person. excellent, thank you. so i guess my last question is, now think of a job that you'd like to have. do you have one on mind? yeah. okay, so now why do you think we should hurry? so i feel like even though i've gone through many obstacles, i've always tried and found a way to excel, to exert myself to a bigger limit than i previously had thought. so i might sometimes feel that i don't have that knowledge on me but i will go out and get it even if it takes a lot of coffee or a lot of effort because there's also a sense of satisfaction in actually giving it more than you can but seeing that actually succeed. you know what i mean? it's like what mit does to you. you are humbled by an immense amount of work. you're humbled by extremely hard classes that you had no idea that they were going to come and blast you with pieces, homeworks and exams that you are overwhelmed. but you sit down, you think about stuff. i sit down and i think about stuff. and i get a plan done. the good thing about the plan, it takes some time to devise a plan because it's not as efficient. it's not efficient to go randomly guessing what to do. but having an educated guess, if you remember the sats where it's like you may not always know the answer or you can make an educated guess of what the answer may be. so that's the way i approach things when i have no idea what i'm doing. but after some effort, it will actually get me to a place where i can say, hey, i'm here, let's get cracking. that's sort of like the general mindset i have for many problems, be it in the life sciences, you have to do an essay if i have to come up with a little sedating mechanism that does this to breast cancer shells. or if i go by, the walks of life can take you anywhere. if i end up being a consultant for johnson and johnson, let's say by company for random purposes. and this is the same way you tackle every problem. you get a plan, you find out what you have a hard time doing, then you sit down and do it. problems is frustrating because results don't come out like this. but i feel like once you get the hang of it, you can start, your productivity increases by x fold, x be a number much higher than one. let's talk mit right here. yeah, i feel that's the, that's at least my way of tackling things and it's gotten me through a lot and it's actually helped me wear down the walls of mit and have a better experience at it. so i feel it's the same way i should attack all the problems that come to me. well, thank you. i appreciate your coming to it.",AGGR,5.18459422869,4.96138468252,4.77781394605,5.91391571239,5.43357511766,5.93992483297,5.45942488339,4.72000195941,4.93924002456,5.43353996472,3.99114903525,5.28503463586,3.70412090811,5.88254765352,5.96359395491,5.93916952655,6.21194854824,5.30574979949,95.0467294143
p77," ready? how are you doing today? i'm doing well. how are you? good. i'm doing well as well. please soundify yourself. so, my background is in mechanical engineering. what i really enjoy doing though is leadership type roles. so i like talking to people, but i also like doing technical problems. so i'm looking for a position that really combines those two things. where i can use the communication skills with people as well as my technical background in a role that involves decision making and different business factors. great. tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. so, recently i'm the leader of our over-project that i'm working on. basically what we had to do is design a speech system. and with this system, as a leader of our team, i do a lot of organizing and tele-getting tasks. different types of conflict management, making sure people are talking, understanding whatever it is wanting. different type of just general making sure i'm aware of all the group dynamics that are going on. great. tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? okay. so i was on a team of, it was actually just two people, but it was to design and build a robot at the end of last semester. and my partner and i have very different working styles, which i didn't expect. i was kind of had projected my own tendencies on him and assuming that if i was going to finish something, he would do the same way or work the same way as i was going to. but that didn't end up being true. and so we ended up at the very end not having our final product ready, not having everything together. and what i ended up doing was just making sure that i used all the resources i had. so friends outside of the project who were willing to help with what was going on to try to pull something together, to make sure i was in contact with my professor, and then try to communicate with him as much as possible to collaborate with what was going on in order to get a somewhat finished final project. that was our professors that was acceptable and done by the end by the time we had finished. we had the time that we had to finish. okay. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? i think one of my main weaknesses is taking on too many little things. so sometimes not realizing what the little things are that i can let go for a little bit and prioritizing a large period of time. so setting us to too many things. and what i'm mainly trying to do change that is just keeping track of exactly how i spend my time. so recently i've been really trying to focus on how long am i really wasting on little tasks and how long am i actually spending on larger tasks. and seeing that is very helpful in changing how i prioritize things. great. and why should we hire you? i'm very dependable. i'm responsible. i will get things done when i need to be done. and i like to communicate with people, overcome challenges. i have been used to working with people in very diverse backgrounds. and i'm not afraid of a challenge. i'm also, i'm used to being a team player. i've worked on lots of teams and know people. so i'm also very excited about the vision of the company and what's going on. and i think overall what i've learned here about the culture would fit me well. great.",AGGR,5.15798232393,4.70513483313,5.20451666184,5.02649956042,5.0684564842,4.39274010544,4.93485037369,5.00651856578,3.70303430915,5.2721860111,6.28962198841,5.04403205584,4.74113323385,5.8994254525,5.6759830517,5.34373011446,5.66348787282,5.77142619702,92.9007591953
p63," so how are you doing today? how are you? how are you? well, please tell me about yourself. all right. i guess to start with the basics, i'm a junior at mit right now. i'm studying course 6, 3, so computer science. and i guess i didn't really get into computer science until last year. and that's after i transferred here from the university of michigan. and then since then, pretty much everything i do has been computer science. that's awesome. of course, this department's very excellent here. so tell me about time that you demonstrated leadership. all right. so this past summer, i guess last year i got involved with an organization on campus called camp kessum. and so camp kessum runs a camp for the children of cancer patients. and it's kind of a therapeutic camp. so the aim is for kids to just have fun. and anyway, we have various units that we break the kids up into that are divided up by age. and i wasn't the unit leader for my unit, but there was a time when our unit leader had to go off. and it was either his break or he had to go off and take care of some other stuff. and so i was kind of given control of the unit. and so it was an interesting experience because we were dealing with kids. but obviously, the counselors are our adults and our college students, my peers. so there's this kind of flip-flopping between interacting with my peers and making sure that they were on top of their job as counselors, watching the kids and making sure the kids are having fun, but also playing around with the kids and making sure the kids are nothing about anything but having a good time. so it's kind of an answer to the question. yeah, yeah, that makes sense. it's always important to help children. so tell me at a time when you were on a team and you faced a challenge, how do you overcome the problem? so i guess the last time i can really remember being part of a really intense team experience was in high school. i was on the yearbook as a photographer. and so my friend and i were both the head photographers. so we organized all the photos. and so we would coordinate with the editors. and they would tell us what sort of content we needed, what events needed to have photos taken of them, or what teams needed photos. and then we would go about organizing the sending of photographers to these events or to get the team photos. and so there were times where just making sure that our photographers got to events and ended up getting a decent amount of good photos could be fairly challenging because we were all busy students. and so i guess one challenge that we faced was just getting people to really commit to their job and follow through on that. and so part of what we did was just try to build a really strong team culture and just a sense of camaraderie among the photographers themselves and try to get people to go to events even when they weren't assigned just out of the yearness to take photos and learn photography. and so we kind of approached this challenge and motivated. it was sort of a challenge in motivating our peers. and so we were incentivizing the taking photos. and we approached it by just trying to build a sense of community and ambition in terms of taking photos. it ended up playing out pretty well, but there were still a couple of photographers who just didn't want to do the job sometimes. i mean, they usually had somewhat valid excuses, but the notable. yeah, but in that, this job still needs to get done. yeah, i mean, that was pretty interesting to me experience. definitely. so can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? sure. yes, let's see. maybe one of my, i'd say, one of my weaknesses is communicating my thoughts clearly. at times, i struggle to quickly come up with a sentence or phrase to describe what i'm thinking. and so i find myself kind of slowly articulating a sentence. and there are some situations where just those pauses and that kind of slow thinking or slow articulation can be problematic in other situations, like the slow thinking ends up being somewhat useful because i don't say anything. i don't tend to say anything rash. and so it has its merits, but usually it's just in general, it's nicer to have a faster pace of kind of like conveying thoughts. so now thinking back to the job that we talked about, now why do you think we should hurry? i'd say i'm a committed, hardworking person. and in terms of this job, yes, in my head, can i describe what it is? sure. so in my head, it's a software engineering position. and so i believe that i can contribute a lot to this with the skills that i've gained here at mit. and then also, i believe that i can gain a lot from the company in terms of learning about what they do and how they do it. and i think it would be a good partnership. well, thank you. appreciate it coming to your interview today.",AGGR,5.08307917339,4.4754932091,4.7794067771,5.27711922609,3.90942489936,5.41064964824,4.93292347874,4.05348209032,3.3480232258,5.15654832891,5.40549448169,4.31123851715,3.76316841209,5.49375970915,5.48499199414,5.46177237209,5.98336451458,5.22206954498,87.5520096029
p62," okay, ready to go? how are you doing today? good, good. how are you? good. tell me about yourself. so my name is julianne. wait, just a little. so what exactly would this interview be? we can say it's a background. it's a short behavioral interview for, i guess, my school. okay. so i'm julianne. i go to my team currently a junior. i'm hoping to attend the medical school that i'm applying to. yeah, i'm studying computer science and biology, which is a pretty new course here at mit. and currently i'm taking mostly biology classes. i'm also doing research in a hematology lab. and yeah, it's a little bit of what myself. i guess if you want to know a little bit about my background before college as well, i was born in california in irvine. and my parents and i moved back to taiwan when i was about 10. so i went to international school there. but yeah, most of my friends were pretty bilingual. they spoke both english and chinese. so i would say that i'm pretty fluent at both languages. and yeah, really look to both california and taiwan as my home. great. tell me about a tiny demonstrative leadership. okay. let's see. so i, as i said, i'm from taiwan. and i'm part of a student group here at mit called the association of chinese students. and what i actually was was a cultural chair for a year. and one of our main events is to create a night market. so yeah, so instead of the outdoors night markets that you see in cities in asia, we actually took it inside into our student center. so we had to work with the leadership from a bunch of different other clubs. so this included like the chinese students club, association of, sorry, the asian american association, as well as some other cultural clubs in order to create this event. and so what my partner and i were in charge of was the food. and what we thought, we thought that this was, you know, one of the biggest points of the event in the first place. so yeah, i think that, you know, getting everyone as a group to really sit down and look at, you know, how much money we had to allocate here and how much time everybody needed to set up. and yeah, so my partner and i were in charge of that. and i thought that that was one time where we really showed our leadership and made something, you know, arise out of that. great. and tell me about the time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? a team. okay, so over the summer, i actually, this last summer before my junior year, i went to taiwan and china, taiwan and hong kong specifically, to teach. and this was in groups of three. so there were two other mit students and i teaching in a group. and so what this conflict arose where we had two weeks of teaching and we weren't sure, because there was also another group, another group of three teaching at the same time. and we weren't sure if the students really wanted us to switch classes so that they could get more time with all of the six instructors. or we wanted to just stick with the same group of students for a complete two weeks. and so, you know, kind of a conflict arose out of that. it was pretty much, you know, three versus three. like three of us wanted, we thought that it would be a good idea to switch. and the other three thought that, you know, they wanted to have more personal relationship with their students. and, yeah, eventually what, you know, we sat down. at first it was pretty heated. like, so two of my colleagues, like one person from my team and someone from the other, had, you know, really strong, strong ideas about what they wanted to do. so, you know, what i said was, hey, everybody, like, let's sit down and calm down and, you know, think this through and talk it through. and, you know, i felt like i was one of the mediators in that. you know, i didn't let myself get, you know, too involved at first and i didn't, like, you know, start screaming or anything like that. and i was really the one that said, hey, everybody sit down, let's talk this through. and so we really just, you know, calmly and logically thought it through, talked it through. and, you know, we were like, oh, what would be the advantages of switching and what would be the disadvantages. and in the end we felt like the students were there to get breath and not necessarily death since it was only two weeks anyway. and so we felt like it would be a lot better for them to have more exposure to all of the mit instructors from all different backgrounds. okay. and can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? okay. i feel like one of my greatest weaknesses is self-confidence. i, you know, i'm not naturally somebody who really wants to take a center stage to everything. and, you know, there are people, like some of my friends are very much so, people who are in the center of attention a lot. and i think that's something i have been working on and will strive to work on in the future as well. great. and why do you think you should get into this then first of all? well, i think that, you know, i've demonstrated a lot of, i have a lot of experience in the medical field as a college student. i do research in, as i said, a humanology lab and i actually also work as an emt. so that's been a very, very large big part of my life since last january when i got my emt, ems license. and yeah, so i actually work here at mit as an emergency medical technician. i work probably 15 hours a week on that. but more so beyond my experience, i really have a passion for the medical field. and, you know, i want to see how both the research that i do and, you know, hopefully in the future, some clinical, the clinical work that i do will affect the medical field.",AGGR,4.71919794922,4.71117492012,4.6226485055,5.41006827915,4.66673171724,5.67148381313,4.57086284862,4.36858845447,4.07067578913,5.09237911379,5.54722887961,4.73650991358,3.9826335406,5.28184005483,5.31926420968,5.14427567089,5.75199126911,4.63778815554,88.3053430842

pp14," so please tell me more about your background. sure. i'm a computer science student here, and i'm currently a junior, but i'm planning on graduating early. so i'm right now looking into either getting my master's degree or looking at full-time jobs as well and balancing that. in terms of what i enjoy in computer science, i really like front-end stuff. i've done a lot of web development. i worked at google last summer on google plus photos, the front-end for that. and yeah, so i really like consumer-facing products. great. do you think you're a leader? tell me why. well, i think i have a pretty engaging personality. so i'm very expressive, and i'm good at communicating things. so i think just that qualification in itself really lends myself to leadership. but i think also, as a technical person, it's especially useful to have those skills, because i think they are more rare. so in that sense, i do think i'm a leader, because i possess both technical skills and then also the ability to communicate really well. so the pairing of that does really lend itself to leadership roles. great. and do you consider yourself a team player? can you give me an example of the time there was a concept in your team, and you had to resolve it? sure. so what's great about mit is that we actually do a lot of group projects, and they really encourage teamwork. so a lot of the issues that maybe i didn't work out in high school in terms of working on a team, i've gotten the chance to flush out here, and i do think that i've been able to grow as someone working on a team. so for example, in one of my classes, it's a software design class. and we had to basically split up the work so that we could get this huge project done. and one of the people on my team was just really not pulling her weight. and so me and this other person noticed this, and we were concerned, but we all discussed it. we sat down and discussed it, and we realized just the way we were allocating the work wasn't playing to her strengths. so we adjusted how we were allocating the work, and then things worked out a lot better. we were able to accomplish our goals and also more evenly divide the work. and if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself, what would it be? that's a hard question, because i'm a pretty confident person, so there's not a lot of things i don't often think about this. i guess i wish that. i wish i had the ability to, i guess, stop and enjoy the moment a little bit more. i think because i am very ambitious and i really enjoy life, i'm always going and moving and doing things. and i think there's times where it is better to just relax and enjoy whatever's happening in your life. but you know, i'm young, so i like to try a lot of new things. and that's a consequence of that. all right. ok. last question. why do you think you should get the job? so i mentioned this before, but i think i'm qualified in a lot of respects, both technically and in my communication skills. so that's just a balance that you don't see a lot, especially in the computer science field. and so i think i can bring a lot to the table in terms of that, in terms of just leadership skills and my ability to talk to people, but also my ability to understand technical concepts, and especially working at a technical company that's incredibly important. so i think i have a good balance of that, and you're not going to find a lot of candidates like that. great.",AGGR,5.9406253668,5.78476933083,5.61262214707,6.55328333648,5.87726145244,5.70229901218,6.07032518695,5.40331120354,6.03985252038,6.39995241196,5.92193874148,6.20526467218,5.90207890505,5.63264672082,6.02975818229,6.30683864478,6.19547364319,6.32504926142,107.90335074
p11," great. so, tom, about yourself? so, i'm a junior at mit. i'm double majoring in management and biology. i'm very interested in the world of finance, business, consulting, all of those sorts of things. so, i've tried to take on different leadership roles that would prepare me for those sort of roles in the business world. outside of school, i enjoy running cross-country and track. i'm on the varsity team at mit. and i'm also very involved in greek life at mit. so, i'm on the panhellenic executive board as vice president of programming and also hold a leadership position in my sorority. great. okay. so, can you tell me about the time you demonstrated leadership? so, i think this past year, the, or my biggest priority has been that my position as vice president of programming for panhellen. and just in that position, i hold a leadership role on the exec board. so, we have weekly meetings. i'm in charge of putting together our programming calendar for the entire year. so, i have to interface with a lot of mit faculty and bring together the exec board as a whole and the different sororities to contend the different events. and i think by putting together all these events and working with different people on campus, i have to show leadership and have strong communication skills. great. so, tell me about the time you were working on a team and you faced a challenge. how did you guys overcome that? so, i guess this past semester, actually, i'm an associate advisor for freshmen and i work with my freshman advisor as well as another associate advisor. and the three of us were trying to come up with an event to host for the freshmen. and i think we all had, we're very set on our ideas for having a difficult time communicating and coming up with an idea that could bring all three of our thoughts and goals together. so, we had to work together to formulate some sort of event that would satisfy each of our different goals. and that was difficult at first because we had just met each other. so, it was difficult to understand where the other people were coming from. but after communicating and deciding what our main goals for the event would be, we eventually figured out what we wanted to do. okay. maybe a little bit more specific about how you eventually figured it out? yeah, so we had, we were trying to communicate via email at first and i think that was inefficient, especially since we'd only met in a group once before. and so, meeting in person and really trying to outline not just like what the event was going to be, but what our purpose in holding the event would be and what we were trying to communicate to the freshmen. i think by boiling it down to the main point of the event, we were able to figure out common ground and then build up from there. okay. so, can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? so, i think one of my weaknesses is public speaking actually and i think by taking a variety of different classes, especially the song class that i'm in now, which focuses on management communication, i've been able to kind of be thrown into positions where i have to give and prompt you speeches and debate my point in different arguments. i think that the practice is helping me a lot and it allows me to become more comfortable and more confident in what i'm saying, which i think helps me in the long run with public speaking in general. i think it's, i've been able to build up my confidence and just know how to structure like speeches and interviews and impromptu is better. great. so, what do you think we should hire you? i think that my different leadership positions as well as my academic experience would allow me to perform well on the job. i think that i've worked in or worked both individually on projects as well as in a team focused environment, which i think is key for most consulting and investment banking positions. i also feel that my mit background and the quantitative analysis that i've done in classes as well as my internship experiences would help me perform well on the job as well. great.",AGGR,5.01043000317,4.5328038921,4.83720040987,4.95785369798,4.29776047319,3.62930217992,4.41268289935,4.89546144859,3.24042620255,4.4623063693,5.81959031851,4.42675262945,4.81446592015,5.0290858603,4.76349535235,5.71777581176,5.91858727172,4.44721087134,85.2131916116
p10," how are you doing? great, how about you? i'm okay. come out a little off guard by the resurgence of the hurricane. i understand i gotta get home later too. yeah, you know i'm halfway here and just turned off the switch, lightning, and winds and everything. so, tell me about yourself. okay, i'm a junior here at mit studying aerospace engineering. my interests are generally in food mechanics, control, design, most of the aircrafts, but design problems in general. i like to play music, listen to music. i run to some other team sports. i like to play hockey. tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership. okay, so one of the projects i worked on since coming to mit was during my freshman year. i worked in an artificial intelligence group in csel, which is a computer science lab here at mit. i was working on a project with another student, actually another freshman. basically we were tasked with sort of starting this project, bringing it up to a level where it could be presented at conference together. we were kind of left to work out the cooperation on our own. as the conference got closer, about halfway through the year freshman year, there were a bunch of issues that we had with basically meeting the expectations that had been set before us in terms of what we were going to present and finishing on a timely basis. and it came down to really whether we were going to be able to, and there were other people's work in the same group we've worked dependent on what we were doing and us finishing on time. so really we had to make a decision whether we were just going to basically get done what we could, but to the standard quality of the expected of us or to try to finish everything and have other people's work potentially suffer because our analysis hadn't really been up to snuff. and so we kind of had a little bit of disagreement about this, but what ended up happening was i went and talked to the professor and sort of decided to make them aware what was happening because they weren't really aware that we had fallen behind this and sort of got the other student on board who disagreed with me to do this and to let everyone else know what was going on and we ended up presenting a lot less than originally expected, but i think it was very much for the better. that's a little bit of time when you're working on a team and we're faced with a challenge. how did you solve the problem? okay, so another thing that i spent a lot of my time doing is an organization called design build fly here. it's a design competition run by the iaa, which is an aerospace professional organization and you can enter a team from any university or group, basically anywhere in the world. it's mostly us universities though and these university teams basically build a plane, design it, build it, fly it. as the competition name suggests and you compete them all at the end of the year, compete against the other university at the end of the year at one competition. basically last year we had design challenges that were pretty unique and so i'll take that as our challenge. so we've just got a year to solve this and i always had one of the subgroups last year, the actual design subgroup. we approached in a methodical way, just like i think that's the best way to solve most problems. we got input from every team member and basically looked at our possibilities and we ran the numbers. ultimately i think that's the best way to solve most problems. we ended up with a design that got the best overall score on the basis of just incorporating every team member's input. just one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it. okay, so one of my, i think definitely since coming here i've noticed that one of my biggest weaknesses is written communication. i really was not intimidated by the thought of it in high school but since coming here i've definitely found that perhaps at the expensive technical skills, my written communication skills have atrophied maybe is the right word. so i definitely, i think i'm pretty aware of this and i definitely like to improve it. and so what i do is just try to force myself whenever i'm writing papers or taking reports for, whether it be for research or for classes, just to go through the proper revision cycle, to force myself to make sure that i'm actually being succinct and clear in what i'm saying and how other people read and give me feedback. now what do you think christian, how are you for this position? okay, i mean, i think, i don't know what this position is but i think that if i do want it. so if i knew this position was i think that i want it because this is really what i drive off of. i enjoy doing it and i would be excited to come to work every day to do it, which, you know, that's like the biggest thing for me. i would be excited to come do it and i know i would put my all into doing your job at it because i would be excited to come do it. and i think that i have a decent skill set to do this and i'm pretty qualified to contribute in this area. well, thank you.",AGGR,4.7251152548,4.45935470754,4.6078812389,4.81274056326,4.38394688919,4.66602530782,4.8790084281,4.77536873711,2.77818282683,5.74780274004,5.61490949295,4.81910736874,3.57596013125,4.44518500869,4.54291134293,5.26788560368,5.82388881232,4.14021962814,84.0654940823
pp15," please tell me more about your background. more about my background? or are we assuming that... i have an idea. okay, okay. alright, so i guess i'll start out with... i decided to go to mit as my undergrad school because i wanted a strong education in science and math and mit life would be one of the best places to develop my problem solving skills and my quantitative skills which is really valuable, i feel, for employers nowadays. and so i can certainly say that i have definitely got a lot better at learning how to solve problems, working with others and it's also given me a lot of opportunity. mit has given me a lot of opportunity to test out my leadership skills by having so many different student groups. in particular, i feel that my position as the 2014 treasurer, my freshman year, was really critical at helping me develop time management skills, interpersonal skills and communicating with not only with people who are at the university, but also with people who are adults who are older than you and working with people in different offices, but also with your peers. similarly, in training students' club, i've found where i've taken a leadership role as a cultural chair that unlike in, say, high school, you need to really spearhead efforts to throw large events yourself and that's really given me a feel of what it's like to take on the responsibility of organizing an event. great. do you think you're a leader? tell me more. i think that i am definitely a leader. as i've shared with you previously, i have taken positions with great responsibility in the groups that i'm involved in and as well as my major. i'm in biological engineering and i think that i've taken a lot of initiative in finding ways to test out the concepts. i've been in the research and learning class outside of class by finding research positions in the langer lab where the weekly lab meetings has really helped me improve my communication skills of presenting information to the audience. great. do you consider yourself a team player and can you give me an example of a time where there was a conflict in your team and you had to solve it? okay. i think probably the best example. i definitely consider myself a team player. i had to work in teams in everything i've had to do so far from academics to my work experience in my startup internship my freshman year and my corporate internship my sophomore year. everything was, i had to learn how to not only do the tasks that was given to me but to also sort of be able to delegate tasks to who i was working with and carry out what was asked of me as well. last summer i did an international year off in thailand and my lab partner was a graduate student who was older than me but we were partners on the project but we found that our levels of technical skill were really different. it was her first time working in any sort of lab whereas i was more experienced. so that sort of created a strange dynamic between us because i had to take the lead even though she was given more responsibility. because more was expected from her. so i had to sort of help her out and get her off the speed with the project. and i needed to do that in a way that didn't hurt our personal relationship because we did also have to live together. being americans abroad we really stayed together for most of it. so i felt that being really honest and transparent with her was the best way just to say, just speak up about our frustrations but also to compliment on the things that are done well. i think that's what really helped. great. if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself, what would it be? so one thing i wish i was better at was speaking well when put on the spot. i tend to, when i'm nervous, i tend to not really focus on what i'm saying because i'm trying not to mess up. and in order to hide that, i also channel the stress in different ways such as looking around and perhaps a lot of intrusive movement with my hands or my body. and also being long-winded and speaking too much in order to cover that up. so i think that just being more comfortable with speaking in a higher pressure situation such as public speaking or in an interview is something that i would like to improve. why do you think you should get the job? okay. i think that i can bring with my skills and experiences someone who really can work well under stress. i mean, not talk well under stress, but i can work well under stress. i think my academic being, you know, having the rigorous undergraduate curriculum at mit has made me really hone my time management skills. the other week i had to juggle, you know, throwing together a large event for a study students club and have meetings with the cultural chairs of the other clubs. i've also had to, at the same time there was a big event coming up that my sorority is organizing that i also have to help contribute to. and like, i had a friend who was also going through a tough time so i had to help her out with that. and then on top of that, completely all my school work. and also, you know, just like keep on the lookout now that i'm a junior, there's a lot of opportunities such as fellowships and programs over ip or the summer that have application deadlines coming up and just being able to balance all of that. and so far, i think that my experiences, that i was able to be on top of all those deadlines, not only now but in the past. and i think it says a lot about my ability to, you know, work hard but also, you know, balance out my lifestyle. so i think that this would be a huge asset here at the company.",AGGR,4.26045910577,3.89965423668,4.41390277917,5.18673046062,4.13475256088,3.97192892504,5.19287067686,4.03751462017,3.15028052238,5.19951210392,5.15224331077,3.73476644613,3.77148901234,4.80808558652,5.05697240524,5.18848519214,5.3218953104,4.38693024675,80.8684735018
pp17," have you been? been alright. school's, you know, it's always that time for the middle of the semester. it's not it. alright, so. can you tell me a little bit more about your background? yes, so i am a junior here at mit in computer science and engineering. and most of my experience here has been actually at the game lab on campus. so i've worked there for the past few years and i've worked on many different kinds of projects, you know, in various languages and with different people. and also i've taken courses here in algorithms, in graphics, also software construction, but i've really found algorithms to be something that i'm really interested in. i think they're really beautiful and elegant. they can accomplish a lot. and in my spend time i like to do yoga. i'm not very good at it and i love food. so finding hidden gems in the city is really fun. great. and do you think you're a leader? tell me why. yes, i am. so last semester here at mit it took, as i mentioned, a software construction class. and in this class we had quite a few projects and some of these were group projects. so the first group project that we had in the class, i was working with two of my peers and they seemed like nice people and all, but we were having issues, you know, actually getting things done, you know, getting a time when we could all meet and, you know, that sort of thing. so it looked like no one was really stepping up, so i decided to step up. and, you know, i made sure to contact everyone in the group and, you know, got us working together. we met up and, you know, i made sure that we were always on task and took notes on what we were doing so that when it came to actually implementing our ideas, you know, we actually had some sort of structure. and our project turned out really great at the end. now there's a bit of a time crunch, but all in all i think we worked together really well. and i'm very pleased with how it turned out. great. do you consider yourself a team player? and can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you have to resolve it? i do consider myself a team player. we're done many teams. so in this same software construction class, ironically, the second group project, which was our final project for the course, did not go quite as planned. so i was working with two other people and in this case, you know, i tried to get us working together and, you know, tried to do my part for our project, but they were not having it. and they actually ended up overriding my code multiple times instead of, you know, allowing me to contribute to the project even after i spoke to them about it and told them there were tools that could help resolve conflicts in the code. and, you know, they just weren't cooperating. and so i ended up having to go talk to my taa and talking to the course, my course administrator here and also to the student support services to see, you know, how i could resolve the situation because i've done everything that i thought i could. so, you know, that turned out okay at the end. but sometimes it's, sometimes things are out of your control and i think those are the hardest problems to confront. but, you know, it's okay to ask for help sometimes. i think that it ended up okay at the end. great. um, if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself, what would it be? it's a toughie. um, i think... if i had one thing i could change, it would probably be, um, being more aggressive, which aggressive is a scary word perhaps. so, um, perhaps being more assertive. i've always been a pretty quiet person, you know, when i was growing up. and this is something that, um, you know, like in elementary school, my teachers would say that, oh, you know, on my progress reports, stuff is very quiet and sweet, girl, they didn't really have anything else to say because i was so quiet. um, and, you know, even now sometimes, you know, being around people can make me nervous. and this is something that i've been working on, um, you know, over, well, since i can remember, i guess. and as of late, i've been trying to take a more active role in, you know, overcoming my fear of people. i, uh, a few years ago, i worked at a starbucks for about a year. yeah, back in, this was in downtown boston in the financial district. so of all the customers you could possibly have at a starbucks, these were the, probably the most challenging ones that you could have. so, uh, after, after working there and dealing with these people, i feel like i can pretty much, you know, i can deal with anyone, even if it makes me sort of nervous. um, you know, i've, i've been there. so it's sort of, uh, you know, take my experiences from there and apply them to what i've, what i encounter nowadays. great. okay. last question. why do you think you should get the job? well, uh, i, i have a lot of experience, uh, working, well, at the game lab here. um, and that coupled with, you know, what i've learned in classes, i think makes me, uh, a really good fit, uh, for this job. i have, um, so when i was working at the game lab, i worked on many, many projects. so pretty much one project a semester. and these projects vary widely. um, they, like, they learn different languages. um, the, the topics were different, some were more technical, you know, some weren't, uh, some had, were more fully specified than others. and so, uh, given that i've, i've touched upon, um, such a wide range of things, uh, i think that i'm very adaptable. uh, and also, um, at this game lab, i've worked in lots of teams. so, uh, i feel like i have a strong grasp of teamwork. and having worked at that starbucks, uh, i've, i've really learned to deal with all sorts of people. so i feel like that's a good asset to have for this job. great.",AGGR,5.6498633772,5.47556263843,5.30299141667,5.85096538673,5.12230560453,5.61139641861,6.4029270233,4.82119120769,4.38928726314,6.13791116197,6.02075351649,5.38770854578,4.92906556617,5.31374761961,5.48804835838,5.91391571239,5.8750727445,4.87644390431,98.5691574659
p12," so how are you doing today? i'm good, how are you? so why don't you tell me about yourself? okay, so i'm a junior at mit majoring in mechanical engineering. my focus is in robotics and product design, originally from seattle, washington. okay. any extra curriculums, any interest? i'm really interested in accommodation robotics and psychology based things, so artificial intelligence or that being of thinking. i'm also, i do a little bit of theater on the side, so considering doing some sort of combination, it's a wide range of interests, so i'm trying to figure out a way to put in a lot of them into one thing. great. can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership? yeah, okay, so in high school i was a lifeguard, and that's, it was a great job, but it was a lot of working with other lifeguards and kind of in a team situation. and a lot of the times, one person would have to step up in order to be a leader with, you know, like we taught some lessons, and i'd have a partner with me, and we'd both be teaching the same kids, and i'd have to, you know, tell them what to do or tell them what exams we're going to do during that class. that sort of stuff. okay, great. what about, can you tell me about a time you worked on a team and you had a conflict or challenge, and how you went about solving that? okay, not going to use the lifeguard as a whole again. in high school we would have to work on team projects a lot, i don't know, in history class, so that kind of thing, working with projects, and sometimes you'd have kids who wouldn't do their own, do, you know, their part on time, or people didn't like what they were doing, and there was one specific time where we had a conflict where one girl just decided she didn't really want to do, you know, any of the projects she wasn't really showing up to class wasn't doing any of the stuff she had to, so we had to talk to her and figure out what was going on, and kind of resolve the conflict in that way. maybe a more specific? in a little way, like... you just spoke with her? yeah, so, i mean, us as a group, we met with the teacher and told her what was happening, and the next day when the girl came to class, we started out and asked her what she was doing, and she said she wanted to go and work, whatever, like, this stuff, because it was just a case of, you know, high school kids not wanting to do anything, so... okay. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? okay. i have a really bad habit of trying to do everything all at once, and i sometimes put too much on my plate, and i recognize that you have to delegate tasks in a group or tell someone one they've given you too much to do, so i think it's kind of, in terms of how i try to improve that, is be realistic with myself on the amount of time i have or what my skills are, and if i need help ask for it, or if i need someone to do a part of it, ask for it, and early on, and not the day before, something has to be done, tell them that it's not going to happen. and last question. why do you think we should hire you? i think you should hire me because of your company. it's a great, would be a great opportunity for me to learn and improve as an engineer. i think i would just add a lot to the team in general in terms of my wide interest and education background.",AGGR,5.0385258973,4.92522086241,5.30169891313,5.4703111305,5.32252595511,5.29124911726,6.54533667781,5.24607811749,4.96411231054,6.36301290995,5.40596577758,5.4523864256,4.3189479661,5.20262948752,5.54080929135,5.46458442867,5.99189398648,4.74835103837,96.5936402932
p13," how are you doing today? good. good. so why don't you tell me about yourself? ok. i'm currently a junior at mit studying electrical engineering and computer science. i first became interested in engineering in high school. and that's when i worked in a lab at a material science lab at uc berkeley. and since then, i've worked at a variety of places, including labs and in the industry, including electrical engineering labs here and at stanford, and promise industries, which is a chip packaging company that is living by. so how about a time you demonstrated leadership? in high school, i was part of the school orchestra. and i played bassoon. i was the principal bassoon there. so that means i was in charge of the bassoon section. so basically, i ran extra, i ran practices for within our section outside of the orchestra we get together in practice. i coordinated that. i also set up events between the women's sections to so people, members would get to know each other. and we could practice together and things like that. ok. let's practice. how about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge? how did you solve that problem? this past summer, i worked in spain in operations research. and i was part of a research group there. so we had, within our team, it was communicating with each other was the biggest challenge because my spanish isn't so great and their english wasn't so great. so we basically communicated through papers we read. we, well, one thing that helped was we both got, they got better at speaking english. i got better at understanding women. i guess they got better at understanding with spanish and also with the local culture. so we were able to communicate by just talking really slowly, repeating everything multiple times. we also did a lot of technical things. and so those were mostly related to technical papers and things like that. and those were written mostly in english. so that wasn't so much of a problem for me. but because they were working in the area already and i was new to the area, looking through these made it easier for me to understand what my role was, what i was supposed to do, things like that. ok, great. can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you were doing to overcome it? well, one thing right now is that i can get really hung up on small details. and it becomes a problem because it can be distracting even if you lose sight of the big picture. but since coming to mit, i've been involved in a lot of classes, a lot of activities, and things. and that's forced me to manage my time better. so because i have a lot of time constraints, i'm forced to finish a project or an assignment or whatever. and i can't get caught up in little things that don't ultimately make a big difference. so by being forced to manage my time more, i'm overcoming this problem. great. how do you think we should hire you? well, i have the quantitative and qualitative skills necessary to accomplish project goals and get things done. i can solve problems and i can work pretty well in a team. i'm also very interested in what this company does. and i'd really like to work there. great.",AGGR,4.2512513498,4.3255215907,4.28864035171,4.59815000376,3.57951004715,4.80335243422,4.38653575142,3.96199384358,3.76952499607,4.12027395488,5.84735266153,2.96796737501,4.91606339181,5.46967945239,5.33775389157,5.75925215917,5.9363674084,3.95360112807,82.2727917912
pp16," please tell me a little bit more about your background. so i'm a junior at mit studying economics and planning on minoring in biology, perhaps concentrating in anthropology. i am interested in pursuing a degree in public health after, right after mit, and either waiting to do an md or combining those two at the same time. what i'm really interested is health care disparities, especially in the field of international health, specifically kind of doing cost evaluation, different health projects, working towards figuring out how resources can best be allocated and best be used to maximize efficiency. and then here at mit, i'm also involved in an organization called globemed. and so what we do is we're partnered with an organization in togo. and they work with hiv aids patients there. and they are the primary hiv care provider outside of the public health system there. and so what we do is we fundraise for them throughout the year. and then in the summer, we go and implement a project there. ok, great. and do you think you're a leader? tell me why. i think that definitely over the mit career, i've evolved more as a leader. of the, actually, the co-president of globemed last year. so the club started last year. but the presidents were not very invested in the club. and what i learned from that was, i guess, the experience was taught me some things that what a leader shouldn't be. but i think, really, i've learned what's effective as a leader so far by doing things differently this semester. some of the things, even just the really little basic things, seem to really have an impact. so for example, for our staff meetings, which is the whole general body meeting, we send out a little doodle form beforehand. and it just has what concerns do you have? do you feel like you're really involved? and there's also just a little section like kudos to someone for doing a great job this week. and just having that interaction and then also be follow-up on any concerns, i think the members really have liked that. and so far, compared to last year, everyone, even the people who are just general body members, not even on a set, are much more invested than some of the exact members last year. and i think that's because we realized last year what we were lacking, like brian carrant, co-president of that, realized that what we were lacking was really a sense of community. and in order to be effective and to really establish a strong relationship with our partner and to fundraise and really come up with a strong project, we need to focus within ourselves first. so that experience definitely has taught me a lot about leadership. great. ok. you consider yourself a team player. and can you give me an example of a time where there's a conflict in your team and you have to resolve it? oh, yeah. so conflict. i guess i'll use an example from last year for glenn bennett. so we were partnered with a different organization last year. and how it works is a national organization. there's 50 chapters. and we had a partner in laos. and all of a sudden, last minute, they said we could no longer go and implement the project. so i was the person in charge of organizing the trip. that was my role on the exec. so that was really hard for me because i felt betrayed kind of by the co-presidents and by nationals. because the reason was because the laosian government would see us volunteer tourism and like they get their ngo status for folks since laos just started having ngos. so that was something i was unsure about. like, are we sure we can go here? like, laos is very not welcoming towards americans because of past. and so i felt really kind of let down by them. and i think everyone on the glenn bennett team also felt really let down because it was february. we had been fundraising one year, planning campaigns. so what we did, i think, like i switched over to campaign coordinator. and i still tried to keep everyone invested and excited for our campaign to still fundraise for them because it wasn't because they were a bad organization that we couldn't go. it was because the government wasn't allowed. and we didn't want to risk them losing their ngo status for a project. so i went through the campaign. i tried to get people to focus more just to remember what our partner does, why we're doing this, and not focus so much on kind of the miscommunication that happened between nationals and the partner organization. and then through the summer and through this fall, i've been trying to keep in contact with our partner, our old partner, our work repartner now, to see how the money we raised, how that project is going and to try and keep people informed about what's going on. so it doesn't feel like last year was a complete failure. ok. yeah. and if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself, what would it be? that's a tough question. i think sometimes i can lack a bit of confidence in bigger group settings. and it usually takes me a little bit to get comfortable with the situation. so i think i've definitely, this is something like i've been working on, being more proactive and in larger group situations. but for example, like in big lectures, like asking a question or things like that, i usually try to avoid it. but i've been trying to push myself to become more vocal. great. and last question, why do you think you should get the job? i think i should get the job because i think what my assets that i have, i combine econ and health, which is kind of rare to have as an undergraduate, this combination. and i've done, i've taken a lot of classes that involve international development, both from the technical side of econ, the anthropological side, and the health side. and also, my involvement in globemed has really taught me a lot about the realities of international health and international development that i don't think maybe necessarily come through a class. great.",AGGR,5.43783307606,5.29873263126,5.11222850093,5.94968877317,4.83846612708,5.71214080727,5.13819640403,4.72327342891,3.94910994181,5.57532599926,5.02860840749,5.77336936576,4.23095320879,5.78512932197,5.6095816146,5.73773509538,6.5081177152,5.05407252521,95.4625629442

p16," great. so how are you doing today? very good. how are you? great. can you tell me a little bit about yourself? yeah. so i'm a junior here at mit studying economics as well as urban planning and within those departments i'm really trying to focus on international development and because i'm interested in either after school going into either public health or public policy type areas but both focusing on international development. i'm from right outside of philadelphia and i am the second youngest of three. great. can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership? sure. so currently i'm actually the co-president of an organization here on campus called globemed and we actually started last year but last year it was founded by a different person although i was part of the founding member board i guess you would say. and i guess last year basically what happened was that the person who founded it i think did it once for her resume and she wasn't really invested in it. and so basically last year was pretty much just a flop. we really didn't accomplish much last year so this year it really has been trying to start over as well as trying to take what kind of we felt was wrong last year and really try and fix those pieces. but also what i really realized from the whole experience is that leadership also needs to be recognizing that you are only a leader for a certain period of time and you really need to be able to kind of set up a situation in which people can easily transition into your spot. i mean especially in a college setting you're going to be the president for a year or maybe two years and i think what we really learned because of the struggle we had to go through this year was like trying to set up that type of system. and also kind of what last year there was a lot of tension within the group just because you know we were like what are we doing? like why aren't we doing anything? and there wasn't a lot of transparency so really trying to emphasize that this year. and we were, so i keep saying we because co-presidents, my friend sherry and i, but we have been able to expand the club. last year we had about maybe like 14 members, maybe like 10 or less that were truly actually committed and now we're at i think 30 members. which is a really, really exciting thing. that's great. tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. how did you solve that problem? that's a good question. i think, so freshman year i participated in a program here called terroscope. and it's a program that basically gives freshmen a problem to solve. kind of like a world problem and so you're just kind of left on your own to solve it. and our problem was solving world hunger. so it's really like a problem that no one has actually solved. and what i really learned from that was a lot about group dynamics i think because it was all freshman led. you had like all these freshmen coming from a bunch of schools where they were the top, they were the ones you know you're leading everything. and i think one of the main problems we had was maybe not necessarily figuring out the problem, but like figuring out how to best organize ourselves and how to best kind of when people should step up and be leaders. so what i guess learned from that a lot was trying to not necessarily like pinpoint one leader but more like collaborative working together. because what seemed to happen when one person would step up to be a leader, they necessarily wouldn't be doing a lot. they would just kind of be like trying to tell people what to do and that was not effective at all. instead of just like trying to brainstorm together, like problem solve together, maybe have like just one person kind of almost be more of a facilitator. and kind of leading the discussion instead of telling people what to do. being like oh this is what you said, like do you want to follow up on that or like how can we best really tackle that issue. and i think what i learned from that was that you know in order to be like a leader within a group you need to be more like asking questions than telling people what to do. and like giving people more responsibility and like making them feel like they're taking ownership versus like you're putting ownership on them. and so i think that's what the purpose of the class actually is to teach you how to work in groups because throughout mit you do work in groups, p-sets. so i think i actually learned a lot from that class just like kind of observing how everything was going on. great, okay. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? i think sometimes i have trouble working on a project when like for example when i have too much time, right? so for example this summer i was working in dc and i felt like when i wasn't given an exact deadline i didn't necessarily like push myself to work and like get it done because it wasn't necessary, because i didn't have a deadline. like i wasn't sure you know when it needed to be done so i kind of was like oh that's fine like i can do that later. so i think one of my weaknesses is definitely like pushing things off unless there's a deadline. so i've really been trying to work on like setting internal deadlines for myself and trying to stick to those deadlines because i think it's like really hard, especially when you have a lot of things to figure out how to prioritize and like actually come through with the deadlines. and i think that's really an important skill throughout life. and so for example like this week i have a lot of things to do at the end of the week so trying to get at least a certain amount done by like tuesday and kind of like evaluating my progress throughout the week is something i've been trying to work on more. great. last question. why do you think we should hire you? well, vote for 10, this is the international food policy research institute. i am really interested in studying the intersection of nutrition and health, especially in the kind of evaluating project areas. so recently i actually switched to economics. i was originally studying biology but i felt that i could, that there's more to be done in economics in turn of helping people. and i really would be excited to learn more about how food security is nutrition and respect and i would be very committed and willing to work as much as you need me to. great. thank you.",AGGR,5.18199437371,5.34720093792,5.39074010003,6.24257893055,6.04992879697,5.92605915325,6.15854457271,4.72690066827,3.57175105762,6.26966089966,5.72615532378,5.34030486026,4.62732782069,5.63384831499,5.66763160105,6.14987631041,6.30464993684,5.58230677681,99.8974604355
pp13," so can you tell me a little bit more about your backup? i'm a junior at mit studying electrical engineering and computer science. when i first became interested in engineering in high school, i did a summer internship at a lab at a material science lab at uc berkeley. and since then i've taken several courses related to circuits and other electrical engineering topics. i've worked at electrical engineering labs at stanford and at mit. and i've also worked in places like promise industries, which is a chip packaging company in the silicon valley. okay. so, do you think you're a leader? yes. i've had several experiences where i've had to innovate and work with tiktarge and project and work with other people. for instance, i'm part of the mit from the sae team and basically it's a club that builds a race car every year. and as of, so we need a lot of money for sponsorship, but as of the end of last year, our website was pretty much defunct. so i decided to take over as webmaster and won my project. and over the summer, at the beginning of the school year, i set up a new one that's nicely designed and things like that. and to get it up, i had to work with most of the other sub-team leaders to get information that i needed. for instance, the specs of the car and pictures of the car and different events for pr and things like that. and it's done now, so it's online now. great. all right. do you consider yourself a team player? and can you give me an example of the time that's a conflict of your team that you have resolved? um... so, yes, because for instance, i'm also on the as i mentioned, i'm on the formalized aau team. and while i was working on designing the website, i talked with several other people, including the public relations chair, about how to design and present ourselves on the website. and we disagreed about certain layout and things like that. so to resolve the issue, we basically looked at websites of several other successful teams and tried to... we basically both compromised to try to emulate things that seemed to work well for other people. and we also got opinions from several other team members. great. if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself, what would it be? one thing right now is that i can get kind of hung up on small details in a project. and that can be an issue when i'm working on a big project. and i think it could take too much time to focus on little things that don't matter too much in the big picture. but i'm working on changing that. so since i've become mit, i've been involved in a lot of activities, a lot of classes. and this has forced me to manage my time well. so i've gotten better at focusing on the big picture during a project rather than small details that don't matter very much. great. why do you think you should get down? i have the quantitative and qualitative skills to solve problems and get things done. and i'm really interested in this position and i think that could learn new work from it. great.",AGGR,4.29498917982,4.28515031934,4.36250524479,4.61619161766,3.41512086304,4.9948436111,3.57619241227,4.31410610842,4.68970797264,3.71637526661,6.32825795892,2.74396947155,4.56058517871,5.09733412477,4.37715778812,5.50384497935,5.13894108995,3.73667098068,79.7519441677
pp11," so tell me a little bit about your background. so i'm a student here at mit. i've been junior studying biology and management. i'm very interested in finance, more specifically, investment banking or consulting. i've taken a bunch of different management finance classes, as well as interned in business management. i've also done laboratory research, and i'm working in a small consulting firm part time, as of now. great. do you think you're a leader? tell me why. i think i'm a leader. i think i know how to command respect in certain situations. i know how to work together on a team. i think that's very important, especially in the positions that i'm looking at. i think working with a group of people and being able to encourage them to work towards a certain goal shows my leadership characteristics. ok. and do you consider yourself a team player? can you give me an example of time when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it? i definitely consider myself a team player. i think a lot of the different internships and experiences i've had have forced me to work on a team, specifically in the class that i'm taking right now, 15279, which is management communication. we're working on a team project together. and when deciding on our topic for the team project, we had a lot of different disagreements. a lot of people had different ideas. and i think i forced people to kind of look at what they were saying versus just exploring out ideas, like focusing on how their idea would actually turn out in a presentation. and so trying to get people to compromise. and in the end, we ended up paying an idea. so great. if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself, what would it be? well, i think i'd like to be taller, if that's not the case. but other than that, i think i wish i was more outgoing in certain situations. i think sometimes i'm more reserved or in class, a little hesitant to participate if i'm not sure i'm 100% correct. i think that's kind of an mit mentality. everyone likes to be right all the time. so i think i had less reservations about answering questions. that would be great. ok. and why do you think you should get the job? i think with my academic experience, as well as my internship experiences, i have enough past data analysis and quantitative work, as well as communication skills and leadership experience, that i have a nice balance of skills going into the position. and i'm a fast warner and willing to learn on the job. so i think the combination of all of that would be good. great.",AGGR,5.81716563238,5.26887499625,5.46611663934,5.71614158498,4.81586040075,5.20239786443,4.67732814906,5.00564796629,4.44347345714,5.30613449428,6.35161124181,5.55037114512,5.65383731953,5.26714385237,5.27173120492,5.94954998278,6.14885632085,5.4363520213,97.3485942736
p14," so, how are you doing today? good, how are you? good. tell me about yourself. so i'm a student at mit and i'm a junior right now but i'm probably going to graduate this year. so that's kind of exciting and scary at the same time. like i said, i'm a computer science major. so some of the stuff that i'm interested in is computational photography, a lot of graphic stuff. i've had a bunch of experience with web development, mainly front end web development. so that's, i guess, where a lot of my experience lies. great. tell me about the time you demonstrated leadership. so i was a member of the society of women engineers and with the graduate students association at mit and the senior class, they run the ball career fair, which is the only career fair in the fall and it's the biggest at mit. so i was actually the publicity chair for that. so it involves, you know, interfacing with over 230 companies and dealing with not only making the guidebook and making sure all the information is readily available to students, but also publicizing individual info sessions and obviously the career fair itself. so it definitely was a lot of responsibility and, you know, not only did i have to become a leader for the society of women engineers and on that front, but also a leader amongst this smaller team of, you know, seven people who ran the career fair itself. great. all right. so tell me about a time you were working in a team and you faced a challenge. how did you overcome that problem? well, i, so for one of the classes, we had to, it's a software design class where you have to work with other students. and so i was assigned two teammates randomly and we had one teammate who really wasn't pulling their weight and wasn't contributing in a way that was, you know, fair and even. and so what we ended up doing is we all thankfully were able to sit down and talk. we were able to get a hold of her and we realized that it was because we were dividing the work in a way that made it really difficult for her. it was like not playing off her strengths. so we redistributed the work and so she was able to do things that were still helpful but played more to her strengths. great. okay. tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it. i think one of my weaknesses is i'm a perfectionist. so when i do work on teams, i have trouble sometimes delegating tasks because i want to almost micro manage and make sure that everything's just the way it is. but what i've done to overcome that is basically just sort of familiarized with myself with how to say no to a task and just kind of, i guess, modularize projects more. so i think i had trouble when i was always thinking big picture. and then i would want to look at every single detail in that big picture. but if i just give myself one part of the project and just, you know, divide it into different modules in my head, then i'm able to just, you know, perfect my one part but not focus so much on every little detail. okay, great. and what do you think we should hire you? well, i think that my skill set is pretty unique because i'm both technical but also well spoken and i'm able to communicate really well. and i think that's a pretty unique combination to have both of those two skills. great.",AGGR,5.80135366035,5.92049301639,5.81055961119,6.04893524744,5.20461943897,5.40361052078,5.76886166769,4.81782795291,4.68969108759,6.31536811668,6.37215246813,6.05344206945,5.67303503772,5.93629021098,5.96548614449,5.82638569969,5.89940186487,5.970077654,103.477591469
p15," okay, so how are you doing today? i'm doing fine, thank you. how about you? have you, like, you know, the storm? i hope that hasn't, like, disturbed my power too much. no, actually, it was fine. i was expecting to be a lot worse. i think a lot of people were a lot worse off than i am. oh, yeah. i mean, boston didn't get too bad, so that's at least really fortunate. okay, so can you tell me about yourself? okay, so i'm a current junior at mit. okay. i'm studying biological engineering. so some of the things i do on campus, i'm really involved in mit midlife. so i'm the secretary of the club, and i go to the meetings, and part of my role is to help organize rooms for poster sessions, information sessions, just to, like, spend the word of my life around campus. and that's sort of helped me, like, explore. it has really gotten me more interested in the field of healthcare. that plus, like, my studies. i'm also involved in chinese students club as a cultural chair. i do a lot of, you know, pubbing on campus for events like night market, which i helped organize just last week. okay. so that sort of helps me with my communication skills, you know, talking to the officers of other student clubs. great. so tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. okay. so last week, this past summer, i worked in a research lab in bangkok, and it was the first time that i had ever been outside of, you know, the united states for an extended period of time. and one of my assignments was to, you know, sort of lead, sort of, like, drive the direction of, like, a research project that they were doing, to research a generic in hopes of releasing it to the market sometime in the future. because i had, was partnered up with some lab partner that was less experienced than i was, i found myself in many situations having to help guide her along and getting up to speed with the project and the techniques that we needed to do our experiments. it was a little bit of a strange dynamic because she was older than me because she was an incoming graduate student, but she did not have much research, like, lab experience. so i had to balance, like, being informative without making it seem like, because, like, she was, like, in some ways my superior. so that was, like, i had to, like, teach her the techniques that, you know, coming off as, like, oh, i know more than you do. but what i found was what worked for both of us was that i would, like, explain it to her before. we were in the lab, which helped cut down a lot of the frustration that came up if, like, she had to ask, like, questions, like, every, like, between, like, every step. so that's, um, that's probably the one way i should do my leadership. okay. tell me about a time you were working on a team and you faced a challenge and what you did to solve that problem. okay. so, the, um, a couple, um, ips ago, i worked for a startup. um, they were a green building resources directory online, and i worked with my fellow extern on helping to market this, the use of this directory to the clients. um, so we had to, it was a little bit difficult because we had to, like, we had to cold call a lot of people and getting over the initial awkwardness of what it is like to talk to somebody you never met or seen before and trying to, like, pitch an idea to them and be like, oh, there's this really great resource and you've signed it for it, but we've noticed that, like, you haven't used it. um, other things that, like, you feel would make it better, um, things that you would like to see that you think would make it more effective. and, um, we both had to sort of, like, teach ourselves how to talk to, like, the reps that we're calling and we would, um, strategize what worked, what didn't, what had people respond and what didn't, and by, like, documenting it all down also so that we could leave, like, a record of what worked for maybe someone else who was to come. so, um, eventually we actually got, like, a system, like, a way we would structure questions and ask them that worked and, like, elicited, like, a helpful response. great. all right. can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? okay. um, so something, so a weakness that i've found, um, and i'm still, like, working to try to, like, overcome it is i tend to be long-winded in explaining things. um, it's hard for me to take something that i'm thinking about and communicating it, um, concisely, um, the first time around because i feel like i always leave something out after i finish saying it so i tend to go back and elaborate. and then while i'm thinking about it still, i'll, like, talk more about what's coming to mind. um, it's something that i've been working on by signing up for things like this and by trying to take up a more prominent role in, like, the, in, like, the clubs i'm in and, like, trying to, you know, participate more actively in classes, um, trying to, as much as i can, to go to, um, lab presentations from my europe and speaking in front of audiences to try to, um, make myself less long-winded and more concise. alright, great. and last question. why do you think we should hire you? um, i think that i can bring, you know, something different, a new perspective to the table, especially coming from mit, um, having had, like, a very quantitative background, um, and given that i've had extensive experience, um, in research, um, and my leadership activities on campus, i think that i can bring both the technical skill and, um, a way to effectively, hopefully communicate to, um, communicate my ideas and bring, like, a different sort of perspective to your company. and i'm hardworking, um, and i always want to make sure that i will do a good job in detail-oriented, and, um, i just love working with other people on, like, projects that excite me, so, um, that's something that, um, i come from mit, with a lot of experience, is working with people collaborating, and that's, um, definitely a skill that i can, i can bring to your company, so, thank you for your time. thank you.",AGGR,4.62531884309,3.96372317208,4.25032022025,5.42906829565,4.53809348758,3.46833614241,4.84185964133,4.89546144859,1.41211232111,5.17953168224,5.44907410303,4.37898259772,3.90089704833,4.8159409313,5.07041698156,5.16895392285,5.24781567325,3.86085352885,80.4967600412
