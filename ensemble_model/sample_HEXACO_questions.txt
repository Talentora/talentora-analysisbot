Eliciting Clear Trait Evidence: The accuracy of any extraction method will improve if the interview transcript explicitly contains indicators of each trait. Structuring the interview to probe each HEXACO dimension is crucial. A recommended approach is using behavioral interview questions tailored to each trait. Research has shown that when experts design questions targeting specific personality facets, the responses indeed reflect those traits more clearly ￼ ￼. For example:
	•	To gauge Honesty-Humility: “Describe a time you faced an ethical dilemma at work. How did you handle it?” (High H-H will mention honesty/integrity; low H-H might reveal willingness to manipulate or boast about selfish gains).
	•	Emotionality: “Tell us about a work situation that was very stressful or emotionally difficult for you. What did you feel and how did you cope?” (Responses can hint at anxiety, sentimentality, calmness under stress, etc.).
	•	Extraversion: “Do you prefer working in teams or alone? Can you give an example?” (Look for enthusiastic, talkative responses vs. reserved ones).
	•	Agreeableness: “How do you handle conflicts or disagreements with colleagues?” (High agreeableness might emphasize patience, low might show bluntness or critical tone).
	•	Conscientiousness: “Describe a project you planned and carried through. How did you organize and ensure everything was done on time?” (Evidence of diligence, organization, prudence appears here).
	•	Openness: “Can you share an experience where you had to learn something completely new or adapt to change?” (High openness might express excitement for new ideas, low might focus on practical routine).
