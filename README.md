# Models (IN TESTING PHASE)

## videodata.py 

### Face Detection with dlib
- **Algorithm Used**: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) combined with a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM).
  - The image is scanned at multiple scales.
  - HOG features are extracted at each scale.
  - The Linear SVM classifier predicts whether a region contains a face.

### Facial Landmark Detection
- **Predictor Model**: shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
  - A pre-trained model that can predict 68 landmark points on a human face.
- **Landmarks**: 
  - Points 1-17: Contour of the face
  - Points 18-27: Eyebrows
  - Points 28-36: Nose
  - Points 37-48: Eyes
  - Points 49-68: Mouth
